The hall was designed by architectGerman Bestelmeyerto house Harvard's Germanic Museum. Its cornerstone was laid in 1912 and the building completed in 1917, but it was not opened to the public until 1921, officially because of a lack of coal. The Germanic Museum evolved into theBusch-Reisinger Museum, the only museum in North America dedicated to the study of art from the German-speaking countries of Central and Northern Europe. The Busch-Reisinger was located in Adolphus Busch Hall from 1921 to 1991 and the hall continues to house the Busch-Reisinger's founding collection of medievalplaster casts, as well as an exhibition on the history of the museum. The hall also hosts concerts on itsFlentroppipe organ, which was made famous by organistE. Power Biggs, who broadcast and recorded his long-playing records there.

Since 1899 it has belonged toHarvard University, for whom it presently houses offices. The house was listed on theNational Register of Historic Placesin 1996. The Warren House stands in the eastern part of the Harvard campus, on the west side of Prescott Street, as part of an entire city block (just east ofHarvard Yard) of Harvard-owned buildings.  It has a2+1⁄2-story main block, which is covered by a front-facing gable roof, with single-story side-gabled wings extending to the sides that are flush with the front facade.  The main facade faces west, into a pedestrian area providing access to the other Harvard buildings on the block. The main block's corners are pilastered, while those of the wings have wooden quoining.  The gable is fully pedimented, with a half-round window at the center.  A single-story porch extends across the central three bays, its flat roof and entablature supported by smooth Doric columns.  The interior features a distinctive blend of Greek Revival and Colonial Revival features, the latter done during the ownership of Henry Warren, handicapped by a spinal deformity from childhood.  The second-floor alterations were particularly made to adapt to his needs. The house was built in 1833 byCharles Beck, a Professor of Latin at Harvard.  It was built on land that was previously part of the large estate ofFrancis Danaand subdivided by his heirs.  It was acquired in 1891 by Henry Clarke Warren, serving as his home until his death in 1899.  Warren made numerous alterations to the interior to accommodate his physical disability, including an overly sized heating system which he was said to run up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. When Henry Clarke Warren died in 1899 hebequeathedthe house to Harvard.When first acquired, it was used to house the philosophy library, and then the English department. It was moved in 1900 (within its historic lot) to make room for the construction of theHarvard Unionto the south. Since 1997, it has served as offices for other Harvard organizations."

As the first modern building on the campus, it represents one of the first endorsements of themodern styleby a major university and was seen in the national and architectural presses as a turning point in the acceptance of the aesthetic in the United States.[citation needed] For The Architects Collaborative (TAC), an important modernist firm headed by seven Harvard graduates andWalter Gropius(then chair of the University's Department of Architecture within theGraduate School of Design), the Center was one of their first important works. The building contains work from avant-garde Surrealist or Bauhaus artistsJoan Miró,Josef Albers,Jean ArpandHerbert Bayer. A sculpture byRichard Lippoldis in a nearby courtyard. The buildings are now primarily used as a student center and as a dormitory complex forHarvard Law School. Located at the northern end of campus along Everett Street, the complex takes the traditional form of an academic quad with a modernist aesthetic, putting it at odds with the surrounding buildings.It is made up of seven buildings (five of which are connected by hallways), arranged around two central green spaces. It contains Story Hall, Dane Hall, Holmes Hall, Richards Hall, and Child Hall. The buildings' façades are yellow brick with a variegated-red brick watercourse and are defined by largeribbon windows. Coming from theBauhaus, Gropius had been a pioneering innovator of educational architecture and many of his hallmarks can be seen years later in Harkness Commons. The physical Gropius hallmarks – large windows, flowing rooms, floatingfacadeson raisedpilotis[citation needed]– are all present here. Gropius makes clear statements for employing ribbon windows, ""Our contemporary architectural conception of an intensified outdoor-indoor relationship through wide window openings and large undivided window panes has ousted the small, cage-like, 'Georgian' window.""[citation needed]Further, explaining why TAC designed the structures in a modernist style, Gropius said, ""if the college is to be the cultural breeding ground for the coming generation, its attitude should be creative, not imitative.""[citation needed]"
