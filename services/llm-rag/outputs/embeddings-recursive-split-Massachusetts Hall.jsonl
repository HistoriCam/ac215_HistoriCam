{"chunk":"Architecturally, Massachusetts Hall is an early example of Georgian collegiate architecture in North America. Key characteristics include its rectangular footprint, symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, hipped roof, and classical proportions. The building is three stories tall (with an additional attic level that historically contained dormer windows).
