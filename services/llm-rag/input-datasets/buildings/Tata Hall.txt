Harvard Business School Communications Harvard Business School (HBS) will soon have a new home for some of its executive education programs. Ratan Tata, former chairman of India’s Tata Group and a 1975 graduate of HBS’s Advanced Management Program for senior executives, will join Dean Nitin Nohria, President Drew Faust, former Dean Jay Light, HBS alumnus and benefactor C.D. “Dick” Spangler, and architect William Rawn at a dedication ceremony on Monday for Tata Hall. Located on the northeast corner of the School’s campus in Allston, Tata Hall will enhance and extend the School’s portfolio of executive education program facilities. The building will house executives who come from around the globe to advance their education and then return to strengthen their organizations, thus furthering the HBS mission to educate involved leaders around the world. “We look forward to welcoming remarkable leaders and contributing to their ability to make a profound difference in the world,” said Nohria. The building is named in honor of Ratan Tata, who served as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd. from 1991 until his retirement at the end of last year. The building was funded through generous gifts from the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Tata Education and Development Trust. “Harvard Business School is the preeminent place to be exposed to the world’s best thinking on management and leadership, and we are pleased that this gift will support the School’s educational mission to mold the next generation of global business leaders,” said Tata. The seven-story, glass-and-stone building was designed by William Rawn Associates and built by Bond Construction. Tata Hall, with its distinctive arc shape, complements the School’s existing executive education facilities, which also include McArthur, Baker, and Mellon halls (residences), McCollum and Hawes halls (classrooms), and Glass Hall (administration). The 161,000-square-foot building will feature two classrooms, 179 bedrooms, and three gathering spaces to enhance community among the nearly 10,000 participants who attend executive education programs each year. “We’ve created a destination for professionals who are shaped by different backgrounds, yet seek an executive education experience unlike any other. That’s why Tata Hall is all about building connection,” said Rawn.

At a dedication ceremony on Monday for the opening of Tata Hall (photo 1), named in honor of Ratan Tata (photo 2), a 1975 graduate of the advanced management program at Harvard Business School, Dean Nitin Nohria (photo 3) called Tata Hall “a gift that will transform our campus for decades to come.” Jon Chase/Harvard Staff Photographer Christina Pazzanese Harvard Staff Writer Harvard Business School (HBS) officials marked the completion of the campus’ executive education quad with a dedication ceremony Monday afternoon to celebrate the opening of Tata Hall . Dean Nitin Nohria called Tata Hall “a gift that will transform our campus for decades to come,” one that represents “a significant moment in the evolution of our business School.” “Although our School has welcomed international students since its very first class in 1908, Tata Hall represents by far the most significant gift made by an international alum,” he said. “As such, it signifies our institution’s status as a truly global institution.” Nohria noted that although HBS may be best known for its M.B.A. program, the School educates many more people through its various executive education programs. Named in honor of Ratan Tata , a 1975 graduate of the advanced management program at HBS, the building was funded through gifts from the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Tata Education and Development Trust. Dean Emeritus Jay O. Light, noted alumnus and benefactor C. Dixon “Dick” Spangler, and Senior Associate Dean of Executive Education Das Narayandas all spoke of the profound impact the new facility will have on future executives and leaders who travel from around the globe to study and collaborate at HBS and then return to their businesses with fresh insights and advanced skills. Designed by Boston-based William Rawn Associates , the elegant, seven-story, glass-and-limestone building offers sweeping Charles River vistas and includes 179 bedrooms, two classrooms, three gathering spaces, as well as conference rooms, for some of the more than 9,000 students who participate in the executive education program each year. Built with state-of-the-art sustainability and energy efficiency in mind, Tata is expected to receive the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED Platinum certification, its highest rating. Rawn said Tata, himself an architect, presented the firm with two design challenges: to make the building warm and welcoming to visitors and to make it as open and transparent as possible. “Can the building touch the ground lightly?” Rawn recalled of Tata’s charge, to explain the walls of glass. Tata was the chairman of Tata Sons Ltd. in Mumbai, India, until his retirement in 2012. He jocularly recalled his first weeks on the Harvard campus as “confusing” and said he felt “humiliated” by the daunting caliber of his fellow students. “It was the only time in my life where I sat and crossed out day by day how many days were left before I could return to the normal world,” he said. “But what it did do for me, as I soon found out, the confusion sort of disappeared, and you understood the magnitude of what you had learned in a manner that I believe is not possible to do in places other than at this business School. “As I look back, those 13 weeks were probably the most important 13 weeks of my life. They transformed me and my perspective.”

Harvard Business School has received a gift of $50 million from the Tata Trusts and Companies. This marks the School’s largest international donation in its 102-year history.

Photo by Susan Young/Harvard Business School Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer Hoping to spur innovation at Harvard and in the surrounding community while providing a spark for the economy, the Harvard Business School (HBS) announced plans Thursday (Oct. 14) for two building projects, one aimed at training new global leaders and the other at fostering entrepreneurship. At an afternoon press conference on the HBS campus, Dean Nitin Nohria announced that the Tata Companies, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust , and the Tata Education and Development Trust, which are philanthropic arms of the Tata Group , India’s largest company, are donating $50 million to the School. The gift, the largest from an international donor in the School’s history, will fund a new HBS facility to support the School’s broad range of executive education programs. “Ratan Tata knows firsthand the transformative educational opportunities offered through Harvard Business School’s executive education programs,” said Harvard President Drew Faust. “Thanks to this generous gift, HBS will be able to expand its already robust offerings in executive education, deepening ties with leaders across the country and around the globe.” Calling it a privilege and a pleasure to “give back to Harvard a little bit of what it gave to me,” Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Sons Ltd., said he hoped the new facility would both encourage and inspire future leaders to take advantage of the executive education offerings at HBS. Tata attended the Advanced Management Program in 1975, one of three executive leadership programs offered by HBS. Nohria said Tata’s generous gift offers HBS the opportunity for its pioneering executive education program to take an important “step forward.” Founded in 1868, the Tata Group comprises more than 90 companies in seven business sectors: communications and information technology; engineering; materials; services; energy; consumer products; and chemicals. Known for its innovative philosophy, the international corporation has created pioneering innovations like the new Tata Nano, a $2,500, two-cylinder car that seats four and gets 55 miles to the gallon. Officials hope to break ground next spring for the new academic and residential building, to be named Tata Hall, with completion scheduled for the fall of 2013. The building will be situated on the parcel in front of Kresge Hall, facing Soldiers Field Road. Additionally, Nohria announced creation of the first-of-its-kind innovation center in Allston, a vital resource to help stimulate collaborative creativity and entrepreneurship across the University’s Schools, at HBS, and throughout the Boston community. “This will be an opportunity for all of Harvard to come together,” said Nohria, to collaborate in “this new spirit of one Harvard.” Nohria said the new lab and the ventures it inspires will “become an important part of the innovation engine that Boston needs to be to remain a great city.” Funded by HBS, the Harvard Innovation Lab (Hi-Lab) is scheduled to open in the fall of 2011 on Western Avenue in the Allston building that formerly housed public broadcaster WGBH . In the facility’s first phase, the site will open to undergraduate and graduate students from across the University, providing student teams working on their ventures with study space, along with access to and support from entrepreneurs-in-residence, faculty, and administrators. It also will offer entrepreneurship and innovation programming. The second phase of the launch will include collaborations involving the lab, small businesses, and local entrepreneurs. Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino , who has made innovation a hallmark of his fifth term in office and recently backed creating an “innovation district” along the South Boston waterfront to spur business development, praised Harvard’s new initiatives as important drivers of the economy. Such projects, he said, help with economic momentum by generating jobs, reinvigorating Allston, and helping Boston to “build on its status as a leader in the global economy.”
