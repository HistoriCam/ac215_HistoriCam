The Harvard Science and Engineering Complex, widely referred to as the SEC, is a major academic and research facility located at 150 Western Avenue in Allston, Massachusetts, across the Charles River from Harvard’s main Cambridge campus. It is one of the largest and most ambitious building projects in Harvard’s history and serves as the primary complex for Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). Although planning for SEAS expansions had begun much earlier, the current SEC was largely completed in 2020 and officially opened for extensive academic use in fall 2021, following delays related to construction logistics and the COVID-19 pandemic. The building is known for its size, its unusually high sustainability standards, its attention to material transparency, its strong architectural identity, and its role in reshaping Harvard’s long-term Allston campus development.

The SEC was designed by Behnisch Architekten, an architectural firm headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany, with international recognition for sustainable design and energy-efficient academic buildings. Landscape architecture for the project was executed by AECOM and Michel Desvigne Paysagiste. The building is roughly 544,000 square feet of program area, making it one of Harvard’s largest single academic structures. It anchors a growing engineering, science, and innovation district along Western Avenue, complementing the nearby Harvard Business School and the future Enterprise Research Campus planned for the same neighborhood.

The SEC occupies the site of a former Volkswagen dealership and adjacent industrial properties that Harvard had acquired in the early 2000s as part of a long-term Allston expansion strategy. Before the SEC was built, Harvard had originally planned a much larger science complex for the area, involving multiple interconnected laboratory buildings. That initial project, launched in the mid-2000s and dramatically affected by the 2008 financial crisis, was paused and redesigned. The current SEC represents a scaled, redesigned, and more financially sustainable version of that initial vision. After a multi-year halt, construction restarted in 2014 with a new design and new planning framework. Behnisch Architekten was selected during this redesign process.

Structurally, the Science and Engineering Complex is organized around three primary volumes, often described as a central bar flanked by two wings. These forms create several courtyards and atria that bring daylight into the building’s interior research spaces. The exterior is highly distinctive due to its metallic screen system—a series of folded aluminum panels and fins that control solar gain, reduce glare, and create a textured façade that changes appearance depending on the light conditions. This façade was specifically engineered for environmental performance, hue variation, and occupant comfort. The building envelope includes a glazed curtain wall in many areas, complemented by the solar-shading screens, producing a layered exterior surface that is widely studied in contemporary sustainable design literature.

Inside, the SEC houses a broad range of teaching and research facilities, including numerous active learning classrooms, general-purpose classrooms, maker spaces, engineering laboratories, wet labs, dry labs, teaching labs, specialized equipment rooms, robotics workspaces, flexible prototyping spaces, computer science research environments, and collaborative breakout areas. Harvard SEAS relocated its main bioengineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and electrical engineering research groups to the SEC. Many computer science faculty and groups remain based primarily on the Cambridge side, but numerous computing courses meet in the SEC, and many cross-disciplinary programs use the building’s facilities. The SEC also includes office suites for SEAS faculty, student meeting spaces, administrative offices, and extensive informal study areas designed for student interaction.

The building heavily emphasizes interdisciplinary research, and many labs are designed to be flexible in layout, permitting reconfiguration as research needs evolve. One of the goals of consolidating engineering and applied sciences research in Allston was to promote interactions among fields that previously had been separated across disparate Cambridge buildings. The SEC functions as a hub of undergraduate laboratories as well. Several freshman engineering courses and hands-on introductory design subjects meet in the facility’s teaching labs.

One major architectural feature inside the building is the large central atrium, which spans multiple floors and allows daylight to penetrate deeply into the complex. Walkways and bridges connect different research zones. The atrium includes interior plantings and public seating areas. Many mechanical systems are left visible to reinforce the engineering-education environment, though key utilities are concealed for safety. Ventilation and climate control systems were designed to handle the high air-exchange requirements of laboratory work while minimizing energy use through heat recovery and system optimization.

The SEC is a signature Harvard example of environmentally sustainable design. It earned LEED Platinum certification under the U.S. Green Building Council’s rating system—one of the highest sustainability distinctions possible for large laboratory buildings. Additionally, the SEC achieved recognition under the International Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge Materials Petal Certification, making it one of the largest buildings worldwide to obtain that certification. The Materials Petal emphasizes transparency in material sourcing, elimination of harmful chemicals on the Living Building Challenge “Red List,” and responsible supply-chain practices. Achieving this certification required extensive material audits, supplier disclosures, custom fabrication, and unusual coordination between architects, engineers, and manufacturers.

The building incorporates numerous sustainability features. One major system is its rainwater harvesting system, which collects roof runoff in large cisterns for irrigation and non-potable uses. The landscaping around the SEC includes drought-tolerant plant species and is engineered to reduce runoff into municipal stormwater systems. The building also features high-efficiency HVAC, with a central plant that includes heat-recovery chillers, variable air-volume hoods, energy recovery wheels, and optimized controls to reduce energy consumption typical of research laboratories. Harvard literature notes that research buildings often consume several times more energy per square foot than typical office or classroom buildings, so the SEC’s design aimed to dramatically reduce that baseline. The façade's external shading system is part of this strategy, reducing solar heat gain while allowing natural light to remain a significant lighting source.

The roof of the SEC includes green roofs, photovoltaic arrays in select areas, and mechanical equipment organized to minimize visual impact and noise. Some portions of the roof are designed as accessible terraces used for teaching demonstrations and environmental monitoring experiments. Materials throughout the building—flooring, insulation, sealants, adhesives, and coatings—were chosen with low-VOC emissions in mind.

Historically, the creation of the SEC played an important role in Harvard’s long-term Allston development strategy. The Allston campus includes the Harvard Business School, the Harvard Innovation Labs (i-lab, Launch Lab X, Pagliuca Life Lab), the Harvard Stadium, the American Repertory Theater’s temporary facilities, and multiple athletic complexes. The construction of the SEC deepened Harvard’s institutional presence in Allston and symbolized a long-term shift toward more academic activity on the Boston side of the river. To connect the Allston and Cambridge sides more effectively, Harvard operates the Harvard Shuttle, including the Allston Loop, which directly serves the SEC and links it to the Cambridge campus via the Harvard Square stop and the Science Center. Additionally, Harvard improved bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure around the SEC, adding protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and new street trees along Western Avenue.

One of the most discussed aspects of the SEC is its relationship to the neighborhood of Allston. Historically, Allston had a strong industrial and working-class identity, as well as a large student population due to its proximity to Cambridge and Boston University. Harvard’s expansion into Allston sparked widespread conversations about community engagement, land use, infrastructure investment, and housing. During the planning and construction of the SEC, Harvard and local partners held numerous community meetings. As part of its Allston development commitments, Harvard supported infrastructure improvements, public realm enhancements, and educational programs with nearby schools. The SEC itself includes several publicly accessible areas, including a lobby with seating, a café, and landscaped pathways. The building’s design intentionally allows for public circulation through parts of the ground floor, reducing the impression of institutional isolation.

The Science and Engineering Complex stands near Harvard Athletics facilities, including the Harvard Stadium and the recently renovated Paulson Stadium areas. On its opposite side along Western Avenue, Harvard has future plans for the Enterprise Research Campus (ERC), a mixed-use district that will combine research labs, corporate innovation offices, housing, and public open spaces. Although the ERC remains a separate project, the SEC functions as a research and educational anchor for this anticipated ecosystem. Many observers view the SEC as one of several major pillars in a decades-long transformation of Allston from an industrial corridor into a leading academic and innovation hub.

Inside, the SEC includes specialty spaces such as the Active Learning Labs, which support hands-on engineering courses. These labs allow students to engage in physical prototyping, materials testing, electronics development, and mechanical experimentation. The teaching laboratories are designed with movable benches and modular utilities, enabling instructors to reconfigure the room rapidly depending on the course. The robotics and autonomous systems research spaces include motion-capture capability, high-speed imaging, and floor layouts suitable for testing mobile robots. Other areas include microfabrication-support labs, optical research spaces, and materials characterization equipment rooms that require vibration control and electromagnetic shielding.

The building uses a north-south orientation with daylighting strategies that reduce the need for artificial lighting. Multi-story interior gardens provide biophilic elements meant to increase occupant well-being. Harvard incorporated humidification control and air-quality monitoring systems, which are essential in research environments with sensitive instrumentation and chemical processes. The building’s safety systems include numerous fume hoods, chemical storage rooms, gas distribution systems, emergency power systems, and fire-suppression systems specifically tailored for laboratory hazards.

The SEC includes social and dining amenities such as the SEAS Café, a food service area open to students, faculty, and visitors. The building features numerous soft seating clusters, lounges for student collaboration, writable glass surfaces, and digital displays used to share research highlights or course information. There are outdoor terraces with seating, some facing the internal courtyards and some oriented toward Western Avenue. These spaces offer informal study areas and collaborative zones.

In addition to SEAS academic functions, the SEC hosts events, guest lectures, workshops, and conferences. Several auditoriums and lecture halls in the complex are equipped with high-end audiovisual systems, supporting hybrid teaching and international collaboration. The largest lecture hall can accommodate hundreds of students and is often used for high-enrollment engineering and applied sciences courses. Smaller seminar rooms are distributed across the building.

The building’s mechanical infrastructure supports the high energy demands of laboratory ventilation while minimizing waste. Harvard’s sustainability reports highlight that the SEC uses an advanced heat-recovery system that captures energy from exhaust air and reuses it to precondition incoming air. The laboratories employ low-flow, energy-efficient fume hoods that dynamically adjust airflow based on sash position. This equipment significantly reduces energy consumption compared to traditional high-flow hoods. The building is connected to Harvard’s district energy systems, enabling integration with larger university-wide sustainability initiatives.

The design anticipates future expansions. Structural and mechanical systems include provisions for additional buildings nearby in Harvard’s Allston campus plan. Utility corridors were designed oversized so that engineering systems could support future development. Some exterior spaces north of the SEC are intended to connect with future quadrangles, pedestrian pathways, and open-space networks planned as part of the Allston Greenway and the Enterprise Research Campus.

The SEC’s laboratories include equipment such as micro-CT scanners, high-performance microscopes, materials testing rigs, microfluidic fabrication tools, and chemical synthesis spaces, depending on the specific research groups occupying the building. Although equipment changes over time, the building was intentionally designed for a wide range of engineering disciplines. Vibration control is achieved through structural stiffening, slab isolation, and mechanical equipment damping so that sensitive instruments can operate without interference from foot traffic or HVAC vibrations.

The building has multiple emergency egress routes, including prominent stair towers on the east and west ends. These stairwells also function as architectural features with large windows that admit natural light. The building’s circulation paths are designed to encourage informal interaction among students and researchers. Long corridors connect research neighborhoods, and many corridors are lined with windows that promote visual transparency and a sense of openness.

The SEC’s educational mission includes supporting Harvard’s undergraduate concentration in engineering and applied sciences. Students majoring in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, bioengineering, materials science, and related fields often have classes, labs, and project work in the SEC. Upper-level design courses and capstone projects take advantage of the maker spaces and prototyping labs. Students also use the SEC for extracurricular engineering organizations, such as robotics teams and engineering design clubs that require fabrication capability.

Harvard SEAS maintains additional space in Cambridge, including Maxwell Dworkin, Pierce Hall, and the Science Center. The administrative leadership of SEAS is partly located in the SEC and partly distributed across other facilities. Faculty offices in the SEC are arranged in clusters so that researchers in related disciplines share common informal areas and conference rooms.

The Science and Engineering Complex is accessible via multiple modes of transportation. Several bus lines serve Western Avenue. Harvard’s shuttle routes provide high-frequency service between Allston and Cambridge. There are covered bicycle storage areas and showers for cyclists in the building, supporting sustainable commuting. The building does not include large-scale public parking; instead, Harvard encourages the use of transit, bicycles, and shuttle systems.

The SEC is also one of Harvard’s most thoroughly instrumented facilities for building performance monitoring. Harvard tracks energy consumption, water use, thermal behavior, and indoor air quality through extensive sensors integrated into the building management system. This allows Harvard to evaluate the success of its sustainability strategies and conduct research on high-performance building operations. In some cases, real-time data are accessible for academic projects in building science, environmental engineering, and sustainable design courses.

During its construction, the SEC required complex coordination due to the need to comply with the Living Building Challenge Materials Petal. Many standard building materials were replaced or re-formulated to eliminate Red List chemicals such as certain flame retardants, PVC, phthalates, and volatile solvents. This meant that the design and construction teams had to perform material audits, consult with manufacturers, and sometimes request custom formulations. The building's structure includes steel and concrete, but many finishing materials were selected specifically on the basis of environmental and health impacts.

The SEC sits adjacent to multiple public-realm improvements, including widened sidewalks, new plantings, pedestrian paths, and a protected bike lane network along Western Avenue. Street lighting around the SEC was upgraded, and Harvard collaborated with the City of Boston on infrastructure enhancements that benefit both students and residents. Rain gardens and engineered plantings around the building contribute to stormwater management.

In the context of Harvard’s history, the Science and Engineering Complex represents one of the most significant shifts in campus geography since the expansion of the Harvard Business School in the early 20th century. The relocation of major SEAS facilities to Allston symbolized an institutional commitment to long-term growth beyond Cambridge, breaking with the limitations imposed by the dense urban fabric of Harvard Square. It is anticipated that over the coming decades, additional science buildings will be constructed near the SEC, making it part of a larger academic precinct.

The Harvard Science and Engineering Complex in Allston occupies a site that was historically part of a mixed industrial and commercial corridor along Western Avenue. Before Harvard’s acquisition, the land was divided into discrete parcels used by auto dealerships, industrial storage facilities, and small repair shops. The site preparation for the SEC required environmental testing, demolition of existing structures, and soil remediation. The presence of older industrial uses meant that various subsurface materials, such as concrete pads, mechanical debris, and compacted fill, needed removal or replacement. Geotechnical surveys informed the design of deep foundations and utility substructures capable of supporting a building with substantial vibration-resistance requirements.

The structural engineering of the SEC was handled by firms specializing in laboratory buildings due to the unique dynamic loads created by scientific equipment. The structure incorporates reinforced concrete slabs with thickened areas to support sensitive instruments. Columns and shear walls were arranged to maintain large open interior spans needed for flexible laboratory layouts. Floor-to-floor heights in research zones are notably high to allow for large mechanical systems, ductwork, piping, chilled-water distribution, electrical pathways, and specialty gas lines routed overhead. Loads from fume hoods, environmental chambers, and high-density mechanical systems influenced structural sizing.

The exterior façade’s metal shading panels were custom-fabricated and tested at multiple scales. Mock-ups were built during the design phase to observe wind behavior and solar heat gain reductions. The façade panels are arranged in an irregular but patterned rhythm that responds to solar orientation. East-facing and west-facing façades have deeper overhang panels because of the lower sun angles during morning and evening hours, while the southern façade uses narrower fins with a denser vertical rhythm. The façade is both an energy device and a defining aesthetic feature, intended to give the building texture and visual depth without relying on excessive glazing.

The Science and Engineering Complex’s mechanical floors house several major building systems. These include air handling units (AHUs) designed for laboratory-grade ventilation, heat-recovery chillers, high-pressure steam lines interfacing with Harvard’s district energy system, and customized building automation controls enabling zone-by-zone environmental regulation. Research laboratories require constant air changes per hour to maintain safety standards, and the building’s high-efficiency heat recovery systems significantly reduce thermal losses. These systems are supplemented by HEPA-rated filtration in specific rooms conducting sensitive biological work or fine particulate research.

Laboratory safety infrastructure is distributed across the entire building. Eyewash stations, emergency showers, fire extinguishers, spill kits, and chemical storage cabinets are located according to standardized laboratory planning guidelines. Gas shutoff valves, fume hood alarms, exhaust damper switches, and emergency power receptacles are also part of the building’s operational infrastructure. Many utilities are delivered through ceiling-mounted service panels with quick-connect couplings for reconfiguration.

The SEC’s interior finishes blend durable materials appropriate for laboratories—epoxy flooring, sealed surfaces, chemical-resistant counters—with warmer finishes in offices and student collaboration areas. Wood paneling, acoustic ceiling systems, and carpet tiles appear in non-lab zones. Acoustic engineering played a major role in the design due to the mix of quiet research environments, social study spaces, and classrooms. Sound-isolating partitions separate teaching labs from adjacent offices. Mechanical vibration isolation reduces noise transmission from equipment rooms.

Students frequently use the building’s numerous lounges and open collaboration areas. These spaces are positioned near stairwells and atrium edges to encourage cross-user interaction. Whiteboards and digital screens support group work. Many students use the SEC as an all-day study hub due to its extended hours and convenient proximity to SEAS classes. Electrical outlets and USB power ports are integrated into much of the seating.

Natural light is a major feature of the SEC’s design strategy. Clerestories, skylights, atrium glazing, and internal glass partitions transmit daylight deep into the building’s core. Many interior offices are designed with full-height glass walls to preserve natural light penetration. Automated blinds operate in some areas to reduce glare or heat gain. Light sensors interface with the building’s electrical lighting system to dim fixtures when ambient daylight is sufficient, reducing electricity usage.

The building includes multiple interior garden zones with plantings chosen for low maintenance and air-quality benefits. These indoor landscapes are irrigated with harvested rainwater. The central atrium’s plantings include ferns, shade-tolerant species, and plants used in environmental science demonstrations. The interior gardens also function as informal meeting areas for students and professors.

In addition to research and teaching spaces, the SEC includes extensive MakerSpace environments. These areas contain 3D printers, CNC machines, woodworking tools, electronics benches, soldering stations, laser cutters, and fabrication tools used for prototyping. Safety protocols require students to undergo training before using many machines. MakerSpaces have segmented ventilation systems to control fumes from soldering or machining, and some equipment is housed in sound-isolated rooms to protect adjacent study areas from noise.

The building’s utilities include a compressed air distribution system, vacuum pumps, purified water lines, and separate drainage systems for chemical waste. Laboratories classify sinks based on their use, with chemical sinks feeding into neutralization systems before disposal. The building also includes specialized gas storage rooms with safety-rated enclosures for delivering gases such as nitrogen, argon, helium, and occasionally specialty research gases. These storage rooms require gas detection systems, ventilation, and explosion-resistant construction elements.

The Science and Engineering Complex is strategically positioned within Harvard’s evolving Allston district. It sits between Harvard Business School’s campus and the future Enterprise Research Campus. Its presence helps create a continuous academic corridor extending from the athletic fields near Harvard Stadium to the center of Allston’s research and innovation zone. The building’s northern face forms part of a potential future quad that aligns with Harvard’s long-term Allston master plans. The open space around the SEC includes seating, pedestrian paths, rain gardens, and bioswales designed to integrate with future development phases.

The SEC’s sustainable design includes an advanced stormwater management system using permeable paving, underground detention tanks, vegetated swales, and green roofs. The building’s green roofs reduce heat island effects and insulate upper floors. Some roofs are instrumented with sensors for environmental science education, allowing students to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and rainfall patterns. The roofs also support small-scale photovoltaic systems contributing renewable power to the building.

Dining amenities such as the SEAS Café serve both Harvard affiliates and visitors. Indoor and outdoor seating accommodate study groups, informal meetings, and lunch gatherings. The café’s menu and operations follow Harvard’s sustainability guidelines, emphasizing waste reduction and composting. Waste-sorting stations throughout the building separate recycling, compost, and landfill waste. The SEC’s waste-reduction strategy includes centralized waste collection rather than numerous individual office bins, encouraging correct sorting.

The Science and Engineering Complex's arrival significantly changed the daily routines of SEAS students. Many students commute between Cambridge and Allston multiple times per day depending on class schedules. The Harvard shuttle system was expanded and optimized to support this flow. The Allston Loop shuttle runs frequently and includes stops at key pickup points near the Science Center and other Cambridge academic buildings. Dedicated bike lanes connecting Cambridge, the SEC, and Harvard Business School encourage cycling between campuses. Harvard also installed large indoor bike rooms in the SEC with repair stations, supporting year-round cycling.

The SEC includes numerous classrooms designed for active learning pedagogy. These rooms often include movable furniture, multiple screens, and interactive whiteboards to allow students to work in small groups. AV systems support wireless presentation, lecture capture, and hybrid teaching. Some classrooms have specialized infrastructure for engineering demonstrations, such as overhead electrical drops, compressed air ports, or data acquisition systems. Faculty can reserve specialized teaching labs for courses requiring hands-on experiments in electronics, fluid mechanics, materials science, biomechanics, and circuit design.

The complex houses several research clusters. One cluster focuses on materials science, involving experimentation with polymers, metals, nanomaterials, and composite materials. Labs in this cluster include furnaces, autoclaves, mechanical testing systems, microscopes for materials characterization, and controlled environmental chambers. Another cluster supports bioengineering research, including tissue engineering, biomedical device design, cellular engineering, and biomechanics. These labs require biological safety cabinets, incubators, biosafety protocols, and sterile work environments.

Mechanical engineering labs within the SEC include wind tunnels, fluid flow channels, heat transfer equipment, and mechanical testing rigs. The robotics and autonomous systems research spaces include motion-capture systems, floor-based tracking arrays, and room-scale testing environments for drones, ground robots, and manipulators. Many robotics labs have reinforced floors, protective netting for drone testing, and reconfigurable partition walls that allow researchers to design controlled obstacle environments.

The electrical engineering and applied physics areas of the SEC include optics labs requiring precise vibration isolation. These labs may house laser systems, spectrometers, optical benches, light sources, and wavelength measurement equipment. Optics labs often have strict access controls due to eye-safety requirements. Rooms may include blackout curtains, interlocking door systems, and controlled illumination.

The building’s academic offices are arranged in clusters so that researchers working on related themes share lounge areas and small kitchens. These shared spaces include coffee machines, group tables, and chalkboards for informal discussion. Many SEAS faculty hold office hours in these shared spaces to foster collaboration. Graduate student offices are distributed throughout research neighborhoods, usually in open-plan suites with dedicated quiet rooms.

Administrative spaces in the SEC house SEAS leadership, financial operations, academic advising, undergraduate program coordination, and student services. Offices are designed with glass walls to maintain visibility and transparency. Some administrative functions remain in Cambridge, so staff travel frequently between the two campuses.

The SEC’s utility tunnels house piping for chilled water, heating hot water, steam, laboratory gases, and electrical distribution. The basement contains mechanical rooms, loading docks, storage rooms, and high-capacity electrical switchgear. The loading dock supports deliveries of chemicals, gas cylinders, technical equipment, and construction materials for ongoing building modifications. Hazardous materials storage rooms follow safety regulations and are audited regularly.

From a sustainability standpoint, the SEC’s data-driven building management system monitors thousands of sensors measuring temperature, humidity, airflow, energy consumption, and occupancy. Lab spaces are balanced with precision to maintain pressure differentials that keep hazardous materials contained. Some labs maintain negative pressure relative to hallways, while clean spaces maintain positive pressure. The control system coordinates all of these conditions dynamically.

The building earned high recognition for being one of the largest structures to achieve Living Building Challenge Materials Petal Certification. To meet the requirements, project teams filed extensive documentation proving the absence of Red List chemicals in thousands of products. For many building components—particularly adhesives, sealants, paints, and insulation—the manufacturer had to provide chemical transparency documents. In some cases, manufacturers altered formulas or created new compliant products. This process took years and required coordination across the entire supply chain.

Harvard uses the SEC as a testbed for future sustainable campus infrastructure. The building’s design serves as a case study for high-performance laboratories in academic settings. Sustainability tours are offered to students, architects, and environmental researchers. The building’s dashboard displays energy metrics and environmental data in public areas to increase awareness of building performance. Some SEAS courses analyze SEC performance data to teach building science principles, environmental systems modeling, and energy-efficient design strategies.

The Science and Engineering Complex is also a key location for Harvard-hosted conferences in engineering, technology, and applied sciences. The large auditorium supports keynote presentations, while breakout rooms accommodate parallel panels. The building’s Wi-Fi network is designed to support high-density device usage during major events.

The pedestrian realm around the SEC includes wide sidewalks that integrate with the larger Western Avenue corridor improvement plan, which the City of Boston has developed in coordination with Harvard. The plan aims to increase walkability, add protected bike facilities, and improve landscape quality along the corridor. The SEC’s frontage includes seating areas, tree plantings, and stormwater gardens designed to filter runoff before it enters drainage systems.

The building’s lighting design includes energy-efficient LED fixtures with occupancy sensors. Some exterior lighting is shielded to reduce light pollution, supporting Harvard’s sustainability commitments. Nighttime illumination highlights the façade’s metallic shades, creating a visual effect that changes as artificial light interacts with the ridged panels.

The SEC supports numerous outreach programs. Harvard often partners with local Allston schools and community organizations to host STEM workshops, lab demonstrations, and tours to cultivate interest in engineering among younger students. Community groups have used the public areas of the SEC for meetings and events.

The building's flexible interior layout means that research groups can expand or contract over time. Partition walls can be reconfigured, and lab infrastructure is delivered from overhead utility zones so that benches can be moved. This flexibility anticipates evolving research methodologies in emerging fields such as quantum engineering, soft robotics, bio-inspired design, additive manufacturing, and microfluidics.

The SEC’s proximity to the Harvard Innovation Labs enhances opportunities for student entrepreneurship. Teams working on engineering-focused startups often develop prototypes in the SEC’s MakerSpaces and then collaborate with business students or mentors at the i-lab. The building's location—short walking distance from the i-lab complex—was intentional to strengthen the connection between innovation and engineering education.

The building includes gender-inclusive restrooms, reflection rooms, lactation rooms, and meditation spaces, demonstrating Harvard’s efforts toward inclusive design. Elevators and ramps provide full ADA-compliant access to all floors. Restroom layouts follow modern design standards emphasizing privacy and accessibility.

Harvard’s long-term Allston planning documents identify the SEC as an “anchor academic facility” for future development. Nearby parcels may eventually house additional science buildings, student housing, and mixed-use developments. The SEC’s architectural vocabulary, defined by its expressive shading panels and large-scale interior atria, may influence the design language of future Allston buildings.

The roof’s photovoltaic arrays are relatively modest in capacity due to the constraints imposed by required mechanical equipment, but they contribute to the building’s renewable energy portfolio. Green roofs and reflective membrane roofs work together to mitigate heat island effects. Roof drains route water into the building’s stormwater system, where sediment filters remove particulates before water enters underground storage tanks.

Harvard’s transportation planning includes designated drop-off zones for shuttle buses, loading vehicles, and ride-share services. These zones are designed to reduce congestion along Western Avenue during peak times. Seating along the sidewalks next to the building provides waiting areas for students using the shuttle.

The SEC’s technology infrastructure includes a robust fiber-optic network supporting high-bandwidth research applications. IT closets on each floor include network switches, Wi-Fi controllers, and backup systems. The building provides secure wired connections in engineering labs where high-speed data transfer is required for simulations, imaging, or instrument control. Harvard maintains strict cybersecurity protocols in labs handling sensitive research data.

Maintenance operations in the SEC require trained facilities staff familiar with laboratory environments. The building includes service corridors where facilities teams can access mechanical systems without entering sensitive research areas. Regular filter replacements, airflow calibrations, and equipment inspections are essential for maintaining stable research conditions. Harvard’s Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) office conducts periodic lab inspections to enforce compliance with chemical storage guidelines, PPE usage, and waste disposal regulations.

The grounds surrounding the SEC include seating terraces used by students during warmer months. These terraces are integrated with rain gardens, sculpted planting beds, and tree canopies. In winter, snow removal operations must account for the landscaped depressions and bioswales, requiring careful plowing to avoid plant damage. The building’s landscape plan includes species native to New England to reduce irrigation demand.

The Science and Engineering Complex plays a growing role in Harvard’s undergraduate life. Many students take introductory engineering courses in the SEC in their first year, fostering early exposure to hands-on labs. Upper-level electives in robotics, materials science, biomechanics, thermodynamics, circuits, embedded systems, and applied mathematics are also frequently taught in SEC classrooms.

Harvard maintains an active improvement cycle for the building. Minor upgrades to classrooms, AV systems, laboratory equipment, and collaborative spaces occur regularly. Because the building is so heavily used, furniture wear and tear is common, and facilities teams perform periodic replacements.
