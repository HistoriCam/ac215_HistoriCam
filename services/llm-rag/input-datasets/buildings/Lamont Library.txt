Lamont Library , in the southeast corner of Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts , houses the Harvard Library 's primary undergraduate collection in humanities and social sciences. It was the first library in the United States specifically planned to serve undergraduates. Women (that is, Radcliffe College students) were admitted beginning in 1967. Lamont was built as part of a program to address dwindling stack space, and patron overcrowding, at Widener Library . [ citation needed ] Keyes D. Metcalf , Librarian of Harvard College and Director of the Harvard University Library from 1937 to 1955, planned the building with Boston architect Henry R. Shepley. Opened in 1949, it is named for its principal donor, Harvard alumnus Thomas W. Lamont . Lamont's general collection of 200,000 volumes began with transfers from Widener, the Boylston Hall reserve-book collections, and the Harvard Union Reading Room. A modified Dewey classification scheme was used, and the main spaces included capacious open-shelf alcoves for browsing, study, and research. The Library of Congress Classification system was adopted in the 1970s. After Littauer Library closed in 2007, Lamont became the home library for HCL's former Social Sciences Program. Four units of the Social Sciences Program‍—‌Documents Services, Microform Services, Numeric Data Services, and Environmental Information Services‍—‌were combined with Lamont Reference Services. Lamont houses the College Library's major research collections in government documents and microform collections across all disciplines. 42°22′22″N 71°06′56″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.37277°N 71.11548°W ﻿ / 42.37277; -71.11548

Walking into the Yard from Massachusetts Avenue, keeping Wigglesworth to the right, visitors come to a wrought-iron fence with a gate. Here, tucked behind Lamont Library, lies a little treasure called Dudley Garden. Created in 1949 to honor Thomas Dudley, governor of the Bay Colony and a founder of Harvard, the garden is open April through October, daylight hours only. -Rose Lincoln

Re-shelving carts filled the Circulation Room; thousands of book returns waiting to be processed topped tables in the Phillips Reading Room. Masked colleagues and social-distancing signage were reminders of the pandemic and the importance of new safety protocols. At the same time, Boucher said, it’s been nice to be back. “I didn’t realize how much I missed the library until I was back on site,” she said. And as her team began greeting masked patrons picking up materials in the Lamont lobby, it became clear that library users were glad to see them back as well. Boucher and more than 100 other staff members returned to library buildings two weeks ago as Harvard began its phased reopening of on-campus services, allowing access to physical materials that have not been circulating for more than three months. Books and other physical collections are once again available for Harvard staff, students, and faculty to borrow, through appointment-only front door pickup at Lamont Library . Through HOLLIS, Library users can request items held in Lamont Library, Widener Library, or Harvard Depository. Users are notified once their request is fulfilled and sent a link to schedule a pickup.

By July 9, Access Services staff had fulfilled 160 pickup requests — a manageable number for their first seven days in operation, Boucher said. Most due dates for borrowed items have been extended; however, users can now return books in person at the Massachusetts Avenue entrance of Widener Library. Staff have processed more than 15,000 returns since June 26. Harvard Library has also resumed services that provide digital access to printed materials . These include the Scan & Deliver service, through which HOLLIS users can request materials to be scanned and emailed to them, and the Course Reserves service, which lets faculty request materials to be scanned and held in digital reserves for students in a course they’re teaching. Scanned material requests are currently limited to items held in Harvard Depository and Widener, Lamont, and Countway libraries. Library staff received 343 requests for materials through Scan & Deliver within a week of relaunching the service. Course Reserve requests were modest in comparison, but Boucher said she anticipates more in the coming weeks as faculty prepare for the fall semester. Within FAS, requests made before Aug. 1 will receive priority. This first phase of Harvard Library’s restart plan is intended to meet many users’ needs while still prioritizing the health of staff and the Harvard community. When new safety protocols and socially-distant workflows are running smoothly, the library will move into the second phase of its plan, expanding circulation materials to include general collections and making them available through Scan & Deliver. A third phase will provide user access to physical libraries in some capacity.

It takes into consideration health guidelines on University, local, state, and national levels, and the latest available research on the interactions of library materials and COVID-19. Restarting access to physical collections was a “significant milestone,” according to University Librarian and Vice President for Harvard Library Martha Whitehead. “A multitude of people have come together in a spirit of collaboration to move us forward,” Whitehead said. “It’s wonderful to see the extraordinary care and creativity going into delivering our services remotely and restarting our services on campus.” Many library services have remained available throughout the pandemic, including remote research consultations; Ask a Librarian live chats; millions of books, journals, and items digitized from print collections; and research on COVID-19 in Dataverse and DASH .

Title: Celebrating Widener
Date: April 17, 2015

Body:
There will be a yearlong celebration of Widener Library, which turns 100 this June. This painting of Harry Elkins Widener hangs over the fireplace in the Widener Memorial Room. Launching the celebration were two lectures. John Stauffer (photo 2), a professor of English and African and African-American Studies, talked about the value of Harvard’s collections. Leslie Morris (right, photo 3), curator of modern books and manuscripts at Houghton Library, shared the stage with Stauffer. In her talk, Morris offered a glimpse of book collector Harry Elkins Widener, outlining his acquisitions. Among his books were first editions of Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Corydon Ireland Harvard Staff Writer Harvard’s Widener Library ― with its 57 miles of shelves, labyrinthine floors, and millions of books ― will mark its centennial on June 24. When it opened on Commencement Day of 1915, Widener ― tall and wide and deep underground ― replaced Gore Hall, an 1841 Gothic structure with wedding-cake spires and drafty rooms. Gore was declared full in 1863, so 52 years later, the 320,000 square feet of Harvard brick and Indiana limestone that made up Widener seemed heaven-sent. It was and still is the largest university library in the world. To celebrate the centennial, library officials could not wait until June. Two lectures on Thursday marked the beginning of a yearlong series of events and exhibits about Widener and its mysteries, history, and marvels. Both talks were in the Forum Room at Lamont Library. Leslie Morris , curator of modern books and manuscripts at Houghton Library , offered a glimpse of book collector Harry Elkins Widener, the library’s namesake and a member of the Class of 1907. He had bought his first serious acquisition as a college sophomore in 1905: a third edition presentation copy of “Oliver Twist.” It set the teenage Widener back $200 ― $5,500 in today’s dollars. John Stauffer, a professor of English and African and African-American Studies, talked about the value of Harvard’s collections. He also talked about how Boston and Harvard collections were influenced by a pair of unlikely 19th-century Boston friends: radical abolitionist Charles Sumner and conservative merchant George Livermore , both of them bibliophiles. Stauffer is at work on a biography of Sumner, a 23-year senator he called the “preeminent intellectual in Congress” in the time of the Civil War. Widener, whose wealthy Philadelphia grandfather had amassed a fortune in oil, steel, and streetcars, perished in the Titanic disaster 103 years ago this month. By the time of his death at 27 — he had been in London on a book-buying trip — he owned 3,300 collectable volumes, all of them now housed at the library that bears his name. Morris outlined his acquisitions, the escalating prices he paid, and the “all-embracing” collection he left behind. Among his books were first editions of Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson; Shakespeare folios; illustrations by George Cruikshank; costume books inspired by his days at Hasty Pudding; and ― a favorite, said Morris ― a copy of Philip Sidney’s “Arcadia” that had been owned by his sister, the Countess of Pembroke, an author who inspired her brother’s 16th-century masterpiece. Legend has it that Harry Widener died with a rare 1598 copy of Francis Bacon’s “Essays” in his tuxedo pocket, one of the nine books he had just bought in London. (The other eight had been safely shipped home.) There is a copy of the same edition in the Widener rotunda, on display through June. Why it was called “the little Bacon” is obvious: It’s barely the size of a baseball card. Tiong Lu “John” Koh L.L.M. ’85, a book collector and investor, remarked on the poignancy of the volume lost at sea with Widener, “in one of the best book anecdotes ever.” It was Bacon, after all, he said, “who referred to the ark of learning” ― the great vessel full of books that a library represents. Koh owns Bernard Quaritch Ltd. , London-based antiquarian booksellers since 1847. The company was well known to the young Widener, and supplied some of the items on display. One is a bid book listing collectibles Widener wanted to buy at a June 1915 auction. In the same case is a faded telegram from the young collector’s book dealer and friend A.S.W. Rosenbach , a shrewd bidder who considered the Harvard graduate his protégé. “Harry Widener and father lost titanic,” it reads. “Mrs saved.” “Mrs” was Harry’s mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener , who climbed aboard Lifeboat 4 with her maid and survived the sinking. She funded Widener in her son’s memory. So a shadow lies over this 100th birthday. It took a fated ship to go down for a fêted library to go up. At the 1915 dedication, Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge added perspective. “Great deeds,” he said, “can arise from tragedy.” Great deeds, as Stauffer pointed out in his lecture, can also arise from friendship. Together, Sumner and Livermore, who met in 1844, were among the most prominent champions of public libraries in the mid-19th century. Within what Stauffer called a “bibliophilic friendship,” they insisted that libraries be free, public, and accessible. Sumner’s voluminous correspondence ― 170 albums of letters ― makes up MS Am 1 , the first installment of Houghton’s American collection. He was a believer in the power of that era’s Harvard library, said Stauffer. It was regarded then as a public library, famously so. The self-educated Livermore, a dry goods merchant who made a lot of money in wool, leather, and shoes, “is almost entirely forgotten today,” said Stauffer. But before his death in 1865 he had amassed one of the most impressive collections of books and other artifacts in America. The late-in-life abolitionist whose published research in 1862 influenced Lincoln’s draft of the final Emancipation Proclamation eventually owned the pen the president used to sign that iconic document. It is now among the collections at the Massachusetts Historical Society . Livermore also famously possessed one of two known copies of “ The Souldier’s Pocket Bible ” (1643), distributed to troops by Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War. Both men ― whose bond eventually coalesced around the injustice of slavery — saw libraries as “indispensible to all members of a republican society,” as Livermore once wrote Sumner. In sum, the two men shared a catholic vision of libraries that Harry Widener himself would have agreed with, and Eleanor Elkins Widener envisioned, too: as sites of collaboration and learning. On the day of Widener Library’s dedication in 1915, she said: Let it become “the heart of the university.”
