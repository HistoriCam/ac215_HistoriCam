Peabody Terrace , on the north bank of the Charles River in Cambridge, Massachusetts , is a Harvard University housing complex primarily serving graduate students, particularly married students and their families. Designed in the brutalist style and constructed in 1964, the complex includes perimeter buildings standing at three to seven stories, and three interior 22-story towers. It has been described as "beloved by architects and disliked by almost everyone else." Peabody Terrace was completed in 1965 at a cost of $8.5 million. On 5.9 acres (2.4 ha), the 650,000-square-foot (60,000 m 2 ) complex consists of about 500 apartments (a mixture of "efficiencies" and one-, two-, and three-bedroom units‍—‌all with 7-foot-6-inch (2.3 m) ceilings) plus playgrounds, nurseries, roof terraces, laundromats/laundry rooms, meetings/seminar rooms, study rooms, and a parking garage. In order to maximize usable floor space and speed vertical transportation, the towers' elevators stop on every third floor. The Harvard-affiliated Peabody Terrace Children's Center is housed on the complex grounds. In the words of architecture critic Robert Campbell , the exterior reflects the desire of its designer, Harvard Graduate School of Design Dean Josep Lluís Sert , to "bring the color and life of the Mediterranean to the white cubist architecture of northern Europe". It has also been called "an extension of Le Corbusier 's communal prototype, the Unité d'Habitation ". Originally designated as housing for married students, the partially completed project appeared in a Harvard Crimson photo over the caption, "University Moves to Thwart Early Marriages", and the Crimson later called it "well on the way to being just as hideous" as another Sert-designed building, Harvard's new administrative high-rise Holyoke Center . Nonetheless it received the Boston Society of Architects' Harleston Parker Medal and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal . In 1965 Progressive Architecture said Sert had achieved "an efficiently workable interior arrangement, a lively sequence of exterior spaces, and a fluent continuity from low to high, and from old to new structures." But by 1994 the same publication saw Peabody Terrace as "an embarrassment to Harvard, and the last resort of graduate students who couldn’t find a better place to live." (The living units were renovated between 1993 and 1995 and the common areas overhauled in 2013. ) 42°21′58″N 71°6′56″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.36611°N 71.11556°W ﻿ / 42.36611; -71.11556

Gazette Staff Cambridge Emergency Management Director David OConnor was on the scene as an underground electrical fire forced hundreds of Harvard graduate students and their families to evacuate from Peabody Terrace on Sunday. But OConnor, whose job it is to oversee such incidents for the city, had an advantage he doesnt have with most of Cambridges other private landlords. “I knew we could rely much more heavily on Harvards resources in this case than we can otherwise,” OConnor said. “The city and Harvard have been working together for 364 years.” Harvards response to the underground fire at Peabody Terrace involved personnel from about a dozen University agencies and departments. Joining Harvard people on the scene were Cambridge Fire Department and Inspection Services personnel as well as workers from Cambridge Electric, which provides power to the complex. Benefiting from the cooperation among the many groups were several hundred graduate students, their spouses, and children, who were thrust into the bitter Sunday morning air by an electrical fire that leaked smoke and carbon monoxide into the complex. “The University has this infrastructure for support in operations like this. We didnt have to call an outside environmental unit to help. We didnt have to call an outside bus company,” said Susan Keller, director of residential real estate for Harvard Planning and Real Estate. “Those relationships were key in making things work.” On the scene Sunday were personnel from the Harvard University Police Department and several University Operations Services units, including shuttle bus drivers, fire group and university operations center personnel, electrical engineering and utilities workers, and building operations staff. Public Affairs staff were also on hand to manage media interest in the incident. Harvard Planning and Real Estate (HPRE), which manages Peabody Terrace for the University, took a lead role in managing the situation. HPRE had its own managers on the scene providing critical assistance to those who were evacuated and important information about the buildings physical setup. Dining Services also pitched in, creating meals for the 300 to 400 Peabody Terrace residents who were temporarily housed at the Gordon Track. University Health Services Director David Rosenthal helped obtain medication for those whose prescription drugs were left behind. And Kathy Bray, manager of freshman dormitories for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, had extra mattresses and bedding trucked over to Gordon Track in case an overnight stay was needed. Environmental Health and Safety personnel were also at Peabody Terrace, working side-by-side with Cambridge firefighters to test the air for carbon monoxide. University Information Services also offered help, providing cell phones to workers and residents to help keep communication lines open. Peabody Terrace, which has 495 units of graduate student housing, was evacuated at around 11:30 a.m. Sunday after Cambridge firefighters responding to a report of the smell of smoke found elevated carbon monoxide levels. Officials now know that a slow-burning fire had started in underground wiring owned by Cambridge Electric, which supplies the complex with electrical power. The smoldering fire was in an underground conduit in the courtyard between buildings, forcing smoke and some carbon monoxide gas into the buildings. Though Peabody Terrace provides housing to roughly 1,300 graduate students and their families, Keller said many fewer than that were evacuated because many were away. Peabody Terrace Property Manager Pamela Cornell arranged shelter for the evacuees, first, with the help of the city, in Cambridges Martin Luther King School, and also in nearby Mather House. University shuttle buses were then called in to transfer the Peabody Terrace residents to the Palmer-Dixon Tennis Courts. They were later moved to the Gordon Indoor Track and Tennis Facility after a track meet there concluded. Residents were allowed back into the building at about 9:30 p.m., after extensive air quality testing showed that the complex was safe. Even though University officials believe the incident was handled well, theyre analyzing their response to see how it could have been handled better. A debriefing Tuesday afternoon pointed out areas where communications could be improved and where certain supplies that had to be purchased Sunday, such as infant formula and diapers, could be stockpiled as emergency supplies. Admitting residents back into the complex was not the last of it, however. The original damage remains to be repaired. Because the power will again have to be shut off to effect the repairs, the work will likely be done midnight to 3 a.m. one night this week. Since fire systems will be down while the work is done, backup fire safety personnel will be on site that whole night. “Im very pleased with the way that [response] came together,” said Thomas Vautin, associate vice president for facilities and environmental services. “People did what they had to do and worked together as a team.”

Vinny Manoharan and Michelle Carter will become the new faculty directors for the Graduate Commons Program this summer./Courtesy of the Graduate Commons Program The Graduate Commons Program (GCP) will soon bid farewell to faculty directors Jim and Doreen Hogle, after seven years of service and mentorship to the Peabody Terrace community. They will retire to Vermont following a year of research at the University of Leeds (U.K.) where Jim Hogle — currently the Edward S. Harkness Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology and director of the Hogle Lab — will be a visiting professor. Residents said they will miss their exceptional leadership, kind natures, and generosity of spirit. The couple are warm and inviting hosts whose monthly open houses and other events enabled residents of all ages and affiliations to find a support system within Harvard University Housing. They’ve hosted dozens of engaging speakers as part of their commitment to “learning outside of the classroom,” reinforcing GCP’s goal to build bridges between disciplines and cultures. Special guests included George Church of Project Genome and Harvard Medical School, Pulitzer-prize winning historian Annette Gordon-Reed, and visiting gender and identity scholar Keridwen Luis. When asked about their participation in the program, Jim and Doreen shared, “It has been a pleasure to work with the wonderful GCP staff and community advisors over the years, and a privilege to be part of the remarkably talented and engaging Peabody Terrace community of students and their families. It has truly enriched our lives, and we have learned so much from sharing with this group.” As the Hogles take this next step, Graduate Commons is excited to welcome new faculty directors, Vinny Manoharan, Michelle Carter, and their son, Samuel, to the Peabody Terrace community this August. Vinny is the Wagner Family Professor of Chemical Engineering and Professor of Physics, and the co-director of the Quantitative Biology Initiative at Harvard’s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “The Harvard experience isn’t just about academics, but also about being part of an amazing community,” said Vinny. “Unfortunately, as I learned through my work on the SEAS Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, not everyone feels that sense of belonging. The Graduate Commons Program goes a long way towards addressing that issue, and we’re eager to be part of it.” Michelle, a practicing painter, is assistant professor and chair of the Art and Design Program at Northern Essex Community College, where she teaches drawing, painting, and design foundations. Fostering community is key to Michelle’s work at NECC, which has many non-traditional students with significant responsibilities outside of school. “My colleagues and I create a supportive environment by getting to know all our students, organizing exciting events, and emphasizing strong communication.” said Michelle. “I’m looking forward to doing similar work with the Peabody Terrace community. “We’re grateful to the Hogles for cultivating such a welcoming community. We were drawn to this position because it’s a unique opportunity to live among and make connections between people from very different disciplines and backgrounds. We’re excited to get to know the residents!”

Title: Making Harvard modern
Date: October 9, 2003

Ken Gewertz Harvard News Office This fall two exhibitions and a symposium commemorate the 50th anniversary of the appointment of Josep Lluis Sert as dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD). The lobby of Gund Hall, evoking Sert’s native Catalonia with its newly painted red and yellow walls, features plans, sketches, photos, and models of Sert’s projects from his never-realized renovations of Bogotá and Havana to the signature buildings he created for Harvard, Boston University, and New York City’s Roosevelt Island. The exhibition, titled “Josep Lluis Sert: The Architect of Urban Design,” runs from Oct. 6 to Nov. 19. Meanwhile, in the gallery named for him in the Carpenter Center (a building designed by Sert’s mentor and colleague Le Corbusier), another exhibition celebrates Sert’s involvement with the arts. Sert came to prominence in 1937 as the designer of the Spanish pavilion at the International Exposition in Paris, a project undertaken in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. Picasso’s “Guernica,” a graphic scream of protest against the bombing of a Spanish town by Franco’s Nationalist forces, made its debut there, accompanied by works by Joan Miró, Alexander Calder, and other 20th century artists. Sert was a friend of these and other important artists throughout his life, and the house he designed for himself at 64 Francis Ave., Cambridge, served as a gallery for his impressive collection of modern art. “Josep Lluis Sert: Architect to the Arts II” will be on view at the Carpenter Center through Dec. 14. Both exhibitions were organized by special collections librarian Mary Daniels and project archivist Inés Zalduendo. A symposium, bringing together major scholars studying Sert’s work, will take place at the GSD on Oct. 24 and 25. Sert has had a major impact on Harvard’s built environment, with three major buildings designed by his Cambridge-based firm, Sert, Jackson and Associates – the Holyoke Center (1958-65), Peabody Terrace (1962-64), and the Science Center (1968-73). While to the casual eye, these cast-concrete structures towering above the older red-brick and wood fabric of the surrounding environment may seem defiant singularities, they were in fact, as the GSD exhibition makes clear, designed to integrate themselves with their surroundings. It was Sert who in 1959 established the degree program in urban design at the GSD, and in his own architectural work he never lost sight of the contextual role of the buildings he created. The Holyoke Center’s arcade, for example, was meant to function as a covered walkway linking Mt. Auburn Street with Harvard Yard. The Science Center is built around two intersecting corridors that meet at a central crossroads, creating, in Sert’s vision, an academic village that would reinvigorate the relationship between students and faculty. And Peabody Terrace, the housing complex for married graduate students that owes its existence to the advocacy of President Pusey’s wife Anne, was designed to create a sense of community for its residents while inviting its neighbors to enjoy its public plazas and walkways. “These projects were very much about pedestrian linking,” said Daniels. “Sert was very sensitive to existing patterns of land use and designs that could be incorporated into new plans. He was very sincere in his belief in the good effects that architecture could have on people’s lives.” But despite Sert’s good intentions, his projects have reaped their share of negative reactions. The magazine Architecture Boston has focused attention on the controversial aspects of Sert’s work by devoting its July/August 2003 issue to an examination of Peabody Terrace, expressing the essential disagreement about the work in the form of a stark conundrum: “Architects love Peabody Terrace. The public hates it.” In fact, the public’s hostility to the structures may be in proportion to its degree of proximity, with the most intense feelings confined to those households on the front lines of the town/gown divide. Nevertheless, a perceptual disparity does exist. Representing the architects’ point of view, Leland Cott, an adjunct professor of urban design at the GSD, calls Peabody Terrace “a model of design efficiency, economy, and attention to scale.” He comments on the way Sert set the three 22-story towers well back from the street, grouping three-, five-, and seven-story structures around them to create a gradual transition with the surrounding neighborhood. Otile McManus, in a companion essay, discusses the reactions of many Cambridge residents, who have described the complex as “monstrous,” “cold,” “uninviting,” “overwhelming,” and “hostile,” and have compared it to Soviet housing. The three towers with their visually lively facades have been the objects of particularly intense ire by community members. And yet Sert, with a very different eye, saw them as the modern equivalent of the cathedral towers and campaniles that rose above the rooflines of medieval towns. There are pragmatic issues as well. As Daniels points out, “On a very constrained site that demanded a high density of use, the only way to build was up or down.” In a sense, the controversy over Sert’s designs is a controversy over modernism itself, a philosophy of art and design which has never truly won universal acclaim despite the passage of nearly a century since its first practitioners challenged prevailing 19th century styles. In architecture, Sert represented the second generation of modernist designers, whose ideas gained institutional acceptance without ever really winning over the hearts and minds of the public at large. There may be those who will never quite warm up to Sert’s minimalist concrete slabs and colored aluminum panels the way they do to the textured brick and neoclassic details of Harvard’s older buildings. But these exhibitions can help even the most militant anti-modernists to educate themselves about the designer’s intentions and the ideals that inspired his long and influential career. “He was very much a spirited citizen, not a closeted academic,” Daniels said. “He took his responsibilities as a citizen very seriously.”
