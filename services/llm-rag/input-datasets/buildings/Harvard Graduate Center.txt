The Harvard Graduate Center , also known as "the Gropius Complex" (including Harkness Commons), is a group of buildings on Harvard University 's Cambridge, MA campus designed by The Architects Collaborative in 1948 and completed in 1950. As the first modern building on the campus, it represents one of the first endorsements of the modern style by a major university and was seen in the national and architectural presses as a turning point in the acceptance of the aesthetic in the United States. [ citation needed ] For The Architects Collaborative (TAC), an important modernist firm headed by seven Harvard graduates and Walter Gropius (then chair of the University's Department of Architecture within the Graduate School of Design ), the Center was one of their first important works. The building contains work from avant-garde Surrealist or Bauhaus artists Joan Miró , Josef Albers , Jean Arp and Herbert Bayer . A sculpture by Richard Lippold is in a nearby courtyard. The buildings are now primarily used as a student center and as a dormitory complex for Harvard Law School . Located at the northern end of campus along Everett Street, the complex takes the traditional form of an academic quad with a modernist aesthetic, putting it at odds with the surrounding buildings. It is made up of seven buildings (five of which are connected by hallways), arranged around two central green spaces. It contains Story Hall, Dane Hall, Holmes Hall, Richards Hall, and Child Hall. The buildings' façades are yellow brick with a variegated-red brick watercourse and are defined by large ribbon windows . Coming from the Bauhaus , Gropius had been a pioneering innovator of educational architecture and many of his hallmarks can be seen years later in Harkness Commons. The physical Gropius hallmarks – large windows, flowing rooms, floating facades on raised pilotis [ citation needed ] – are all present here. Gropius makes clear statements for employing ribbon windows, "Our contemporary architectural conception of an intensified outdoor-indoor relationship through wide window openings and large undivided window panes has ousted the small, cage-like, 'Georgian' window." [ citation needed ] Further, explaining why TAC designed the structures in a modernist style, Gropius said, "if the college is to be the cultural breeding ground for the coming generation, its attitude should be creative, not imitative."

Detail of “Design for a Multimedia Trade Fair Booth,” Herbert Bayer, 1924. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer A hundred years later, the Bauhaus is everywhere. Much of today’s “mod” furniture — from teak and tubular tables to simple yet graceful sofas to chairs and lamps that blend form and function — has its origins in the Bauhaus, the 20th century German modern art/crafts and design school turned major cultural movement. Similarly, the open floor plan embraced by millions of homeowners is rooted in the Bauhaus approach to architecture, one that rejected decorative details in favor of functional design, smooth and flat surfaces, sharp angles, and cubic shapes.

For Bauhaus architects and designers, a happy home was one that was deceptively simple and highly organized. The founder of Bauhaus was Walter Gropius, a Prussian architect who hoped his experimental school would “bring together all creative effort into one whole, to reunify all the disciplines of practical art — sculpture, painting, handicrafts, and crafts — as inseparable components of a new architecture.” Gropius succeeded spectacularly, setting a modern current in motion. He eventually moved to the U.S. and taught for many years at Harvard, ensuring that the University would have its first modern building, as well as one of the most comprehensive Bauhaus collections in the world. Beginning Friday and running through July, much of that collection will be on display. Visitors to the Harvard Art Museums’ third floor will find a trove of Bauhaus productions, including photographs, student exercises, textiles, topography, iconic design objects, and archival ephemera as part of “The Bauhaus and Harvard,” an exhibition timed to the centennial of the school’s founding.

Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer; images @ President and Fellows of Harvard College “There is so much diversity there. It’s not one style, it’s not one artist, it’s not one material. It’s just this incredible creativity and innovation in so many different areas,” said Laura Muir, research curator for academic and public programs and former assistant curator of Harvard’s Busch-Reisinger Museum, who organized the new exhibition. The show features nearly 200 works drawn almost entirely from the Busch-Reisinger’s extensive Bauhaus holdings and explores three themes: the objects made at the Bauhaus in Germany; Bauhaus teaching in the U.S.; and the Bauhaus at Harvard’s Graduate Center. Gropius’ experimental school emerged amid the cultural flourishing of Weimar Germany and embraced the utopian ideal that great design could change the world. First located in Weimar, then in Dessau, and finally in Berlin, the Bauhaus brought together artists and craftspeople, designers and architects on residential campuses offering workshops, organized by materials, where the participants explored new ways to create and teach. In the museums’ first gallery, a series of exercises from the school’s preliminary course, a requirement that introduced enrollees to basic design and color theory, reminds viewers “that the Bauhaus was first and foremost a school,” said Muir. Other items in the show demonstrate how students and their instructors routinely pushed artistic boundaries. Hungarian architect and designer Marcel Breuer created his Club Chair (B3), or Wassily Chair, a blend of fabric and tubular steel that was inspired by his curved bicycle handlebars, while he was a student at the school in 1925. The work became the blueprint for countless contemporary designs and underscored the movement’s embrace of a lean aesthetic and modern materials. Eventually, Breuer became an instructor at the school’s furniture workshop. Laura Muir, research curator for academic and public programs and former assistant curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum, organized “The Bauhaus and Harvard.” In the foreground is “Construction in Sheet Metal,” Hannes Beckmann, 1950, @ President and Fellows of Harvard College. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer The Bauhaus’ experimental ethos is also exemplified in László Moholy-Nagy’s electrically powered swirling kinetic sculpture of metal, glass, and plastic titled “Light Prop for an Electric Stage.” A seminal work in the history of 20th-century sculpture, it was designed to cast shadows, colors, and patterns on an adjacent wall as its moving perforated discs and screens interacted with a beam of light. Intended to be mass produced for use in theaters, the piece was a revolutionary mix of art and technology when it debuted in a Paris exhibition in 1930. At one point, Gropius aptly described Moholy-Nagy as an artist who “ventured into ever-newer experiments with the curiosity of a scientist.” While Moholy-Nagy and artists Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee are some of the names most often associated with the movement, the exhibit also highlights a range of less-recognized but prodigiously talented creators, designers, and instructors at the Bauhaus, many of them women. “We wanted to show the breadth and depth of the collection and foreground some of these lesser-known figures and their contributions,” said Muir. One of those figures was Lucia Moholy, whose evocative black-and-white photograph “Bauhaus Masters’ Housing, Dessau, 1925-1926: Lucia Moholy and László Moholy-Nagy’s Living Room,” was, like many of her images, a sophisticated work of art and a polished promotional tool. “Through her photographs, the Bauhaus was constructing its image,” said Muir, “crafting a vision of modern living, something that was clean, uncluttered, and meant less work for the housewife.” Marcel Breuer’s “Club Chair.” © President and Fellows of Harvard College Once students completed the introductory course, they joined one of the Bauhaus workshops, with women typically assigned to weaving. The resulting work was exceptional but not fully recognized until the Bauhaus shifted its focus from crafting one-of-a-kind pieces to creating prototypes for mass production, making the weaving workshops some of the most successful at the school. Textile artist and printmaker Anni Albers, who was fascinated with a fabric’s role and appearance, was a driver of that success. Samples of her wall coverings and other material on view point to her interest in experimenting with unconventional materials such as cellophane and twisted paper. Another Bauhaus weaver, Otti Berger, became a sought-after designer of fabrics. She was first a student and later a teacher at the Bauhaus, and a swatch of her handweaving highlights her experimenting with patterns. “She was incredibly talented and successful at the time, and one of the few people who received patents for her work,” said Muir. But Berger’s blossoming career was cut short when she was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944. Study for “Verdure,” Herbert Bayer, 1950. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer The Bauhaus’ ties to Harvard are concrete, literally. After the German school closed in 1933, Gropius moved to America, where he became a professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design. While there, he encouraged many of his Bauhaus colleagues to join him. He also collaborated with Busch-Reisinger curator Charles L. Kuhn to establish an archive at the museum, laying the groundwork for the museums’ collection. Gropius also founded The Architects Collaborative, an architectural based firm in Cambridge that designed the Harvard Graduate Center in 1950, the first modern building on Harvard’s campus. The structure at Harvard Law School was renamed the Caspersen Center, a cluster of simple, flat-roofed, sleek dormitories of steel and concrete arranged around a small courtyard. Gropius wanted the building to mimic the “quadrangle structure so central to the Harvard tradition, but in a very modernist language,” said Muir. Gropius also wanted the building to incorporate contemporary art and pushed for a budget that would cover the cost of such art there. Today, visitors to the Caspersen Center will find a floor-to-ceiling relief of yellow masonry brick called “America” (1950) by Bauhaus contemporary Josef Albers integrated into the wall of the building’s Harkness Commons fireplace. A photograph of the work, a modern construction inspired by the pre-Columbian Mitla ruins in Mexico, is on view in the show. An adjoining gallery on the museums’ third floor contains “Hans Arp’s Constellations II,” another of the site-specific works commissioned for the Graduate Center, consisting of a 13-panel wall relief. The artist turned graphic designer Herbert Bayer’s massive oil-on-canvas abstraction titled “Verdure,” which once hung in the Harkness dining room, is one of the most striking works in the exhibit. Too big to fit in the museums’ freight elevators, the piece, which measures 6 feet by 20 feet, was hoisted up through the stairwell to the third floor. “It’s among the many works people will be surprised by” said Muir.

Harvard Law School Library, Historical & Special Collections; Harvard University Archives But much smaller, more discrete works that highlight the modernist movement’s influence in the U.S. also surprise. Desperate to escape Nazi Germany, many Bauhaus artists fled to America in the 1930s and ’40s and became instructors at colleges around the country, where they taught a new generation to experiment with art, architecture, design, and technology. (Moholy-Nagy famously brought the movement to Chicago, creating the New Bauhaus in 1937. The school still exists as the IIT Institute of Design.) One of the final galleries shows exercises, produced in the 1940s by students studying with Bauhaus teachers at Brooklyn College, Newcomb College, and Black Mountain College, that illustrate the movement’s lasting reach and impact. A series of paper sculptures in a vitrine produced by the students of Newcomb College’s art school dean Robert D. Field (who worked at Harvard and trained with Gropius), highlight the Bauhaus embrace of simple geometric shapes and materials. The studies, in addition to being “so beautiful in and of themselves,” said Muir, “truly document the spread of Bauhaus in America.” Click here for a list of events related to the Bauhaus centennial that are happening across Harvard.

Title: A gala for Dudley at 20
Date: October 26, 2011
Source: https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/10/dudley-gala/

Body:
At Dudley House, fruitful collisions across academic boundaries happen informally. Just before the lunch rush, there’s still time to enjoy a quiet conversation. But during mealtimes, the first-floor café transforms into a stimulating bedlam of faculty, staff, and students. Meghan Dhaliwal/Harvard Staff Photographer Corydon Ireland Harvard Staff Writer Harvard’s Dudley House , the center of student life at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS), is also a home, complete with a mother, a father, a favorite aunt, a place to eat, and a place to play. The Graduate Student Center at GSAS — its formal name — turns 20 years this month, so a house party is in order: a cocktail reception from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday. President Drew Faust will be on hand. The party will be in the Dudley Café, one of two restaurants in the House. (The other, tucked in the basement like a Beat-era coffee house, is Café Gato Rojo.) Dudley is the first and oldest such House for graduate students in the Ivy League. “This is the Mother House,” said Dudley administrator Susan Zawalich . Yale’s McDougal Center is 14 years old. A similar graduate center at the University of Pennsylvania is even younger, and Columbia has one on the drawing board. Before Dudley opened, Harvard graduate students had only their own departments to fall back on for community — or spent long, isolating hours in libraries or laboratories. “Everyone needs a community; everyone needs a connection,” said Zawalich, who can fairly be described as the favorite aunt of Dudley House. Her third-floor office, which is complete with a sign that reads “Shambles,” is full of toys, dolls, stuffed animals, and zany hats. There is even a life-size cutout of Dr. Who. “We call it the Office of Toy Therapy,” said Harvard Medical School biophysicist James M. Hogle . He and his wife, Doreen, a partner in a Concord law firm, are co-masters of Dudley — what you might call the mother and father in charge. Hogle, who is the Edward S. Harkness Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, looks like the dad. He has gray, mutton-chop whiskers and is burly and affable. “The building is Lehman Hall, but the spirit inside is Dudley House,” said Hogle. “We are relaxed about things. There’s a lot of laughter.” He and his wife have a message for the nearly 4,000 pressed and pressured graduate students in 57 programs, departments, and divisions at GSAS: It’s OK to relax, and to pursue interests and friendships outside your disciplines. GSAS — the only School at Harvard to offer the Ph.D. degree — embraces the interdisciplinary ethos that Dudley signifies. There are 16 interfaculty Ph.D. programs and 15 formal secondary fields for Ph.D. studies, a deliberate academic fusion of the sciences with the arts and humanities. Dudley is “a showcase of scholarly diversity,” agreed GSAS Dean Allan M. Brandt . “But it’s also a place where the global diversity of our student body is fully expressed. GSAS is home to Harvard’s largest population of international students, and they come together at Dudley to share important cultural traditions.” At Dudley House, fruitful collisions across academic boundaries happen informally. During mealtimes, the first-floor café is a stimulating bedlam of faculty, staff, and students. Dudley House fellows, who total 25 to 30 a year, oversee an expansive set of programs, parties, and events. Graduate students can go on arts outings, take planned hikes, perform public service, sit in on a knitting group, join a language table, attend writing boot camps, put on a play, write for a literary magazine, or take in free films. Dudley’s affiliates can join intramural teams that compete with Harvard undergraduate Houses in crew. Or they can join the House jazz band, orchestra, chorus, or World Music Ensemble. Brandt said Dudley “is really a microcosm of the broader opportunities — and the extraordinary resources — of Harvard itself.” Hogle sees Dudley as “a welcoming place for students to be, to enrich their lives whenever they have time.” At the beginning of each school year, there are nearly two weeks of dinners, parties, and other events open to new and returning students. One highlight event is Discover Dudley. This year’s theme was the Roaring ’20s. (Hogle showed up as Babe Ruth.) There also is a winter formal dance, a concert by Dudley’s music groups each spring, and an annual party at Commencement. Dudley has a library, a game room, and a lounge. Students also use the GSAS Housing Services office, the Student Affairs Office, the Student Services Office, and writing tutors. “A lot of what they need is here,” said Hogle. “We make a point about being knowledgeable about resources.” Dudley Hall opened on Dunster Street in 1935 as a center for nonresident students. That building was razed to make room for the Holyoke Center, and operations moved to Lehman Hall in 1967. In 1991, then-President Neil Rudenstine presided over the October opening ceremony for the graduate student center. Dudley was quickly “a tremendous meeting ground,” said Glenn R. Brody Magid, A.M. ’96, who was in the first cohort of Dudley fellows. “It was always a part of the texture of my experience.” Magid is now assistant dean of upperclass and concentration advising. His Holyoke Center office overlooks Lehman Hall. “I can swivel” in my chair, he said, “and see my origins.” Discussions about a graduate student center started 75 years ago, said GSAS Administrative Dean Margot Gill. The first real attempt at a center came in 1950-51, she said, with the construction of the Harkness Center and its seven associated dormitories. The buildings were intended for GSAS graduate students, as well as students in law, design, education, and public administration. But by the late 1960s, said Gill, Harvard Law School assumed control of Harkness and five of the dormitories. In the mid-1980s, then-GSAS Dean Sally Falk Moore and Administrative Dean John Fox revived the idea of a graduate center. “By 1989, the idea of Dudley House was beginning to take shape,” said Gill, and then-GSAS Dean Brendan Maher was soon close to an agreement between Harvard College and GSAS. The Graduate Student Council made a plea to President Derek Bok for “A Place of Our Own,” a sentiment memorialized on buttons. By 1990, GSAS alumni had rallied behind the cause, said Gill, adding that some members of that committee “are still active and fiercely loyal.” One of them is Homer Hagedorn , A.M. ’51, Ph.D. ’55, a former grad student in history who now lives in Lexington. He’s been associated with the Harvard Graduate School Alumni Association Council since the 1970s, and was a chair of the group. “It was worth yelling about,” said Hagedorn, who put an “A Place of Our Own” button on his academic gown one Commencement. “There was really nothing being done that provided any support to socializing among graduate students. Its time had come.” Dudley House makes the GSAS experience different — open and welcoming, he said. “It provides a social dimension to life that is not otherwise available to graduate students.” Chit-chat Ph.D. students Erin Henry (left) and Jessica Tollette gathered at a meeting of the W.E.B. Du Bois Graduate Society at Dudley House last year. Dancing in the moonlight GSAS students dance the night away at the annual winter formal at Dudley House. This year’s formal is set for Dec. 3.

Title: The art of architecture
Date: February 16, 2011

Body:
Starting in 1636, Harvard officials decided structure by structure what to construct. But somewhere along the way, the built environment began to have a reverse effect, influencing how faculty, students, and staff behaved and interacted in daily life. The resulting campus developed what could be called “the Harvard look.” Photo details by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer Harvard is muted red bricks and mortar. That’s its public image. But look around, and you’ll quickly see many campus buildings made of wood, granite, marble, concrete, steel, and glass. While the brick buildings of the Yard and the Neo-Georgian river Houses depict the expected image of ivy classicism, the University actually has a sweeping range of building styles that, taken together, amount to an informal history of American architecture. A walker can sample almost 300 years of innovative designs in an easy stroll. Harvard’s eclectic architectural mix helps to explain its values, its academic priorities, its responses to new teaching methods, its desire for stronger collaboration, its embrace of the urban environment, and its ongoing flexibility. Starting in 1636, Harvard officials decided structure by structure what to construct. But somewhere along the way, the built environment began to have a reverse effect, influencing how faculty, students, and staff behaved and interacted in daily life. The resulting campus developed what could be called “the Harvard look.” Sever Hall Completed in 1880, Sever Hall is the product of the noted architect and Harvard alumnus Henry Hobson Richardson. Using his bold, Romanesque style, Richardson crafted Sever of red brick, but also incorporated lush ornamentation into his design. Carpenter Center In 1963, Le Corbusier, another famed architect, added the shock of the modern to Quincy Street, where his Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts opened in counterpoint to the grand, brick Fogg Museum next door. Holyoke Center Inside and outside Sert’s Holyoke Center, shops and restaurants contribute to a lively streetscape. Massachusetts Hall Among Harvard’s roughly 660 buildings, Massachusetts Hall is the oldest. Early Georgian in style, its simple construction, symmetry, and modest accents — like its belt course, a row of raised bricks that run along the façade — make it an architectural favorite of many critics. Harkness Commons Famed architect Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus school, designed the Harvard Graduate Center, now known as Harkness Commons, a cluster of buildings that became the first modernist structure on campus. University Hall University Hall was designed by acclaimed architect and Harvard graduate Charles Bulfinch in 1813. Science Center Former GSD Dean Josep Lluis Sert designed the Science Center, seen here, against a pink sky. “There is a quality of intimacy and adaptability about the Harvard campus that clearly distinguishes it from other universities,” said Andrea Leers, former director of the Master in Urban Design degree programs and adjunct professor of architecture and urban design at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design (GSD). Leers, who has worked on Harvard projects that included expanding the Science Center and the New College Theatre, said, “The different styles of architecture within the continuity of the Harvard campus fabric speak of the directness, richness, and diversity of the intellectual life of the campus … The flexibility of attitudes about the architecture of Harvard reflects its fundamental spirit of openness and inquiry.” “Buildings in any academic institution both represent and enable its aspirations and activities,” said GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi. “Many of the buildings at Harvard are distinctive pieces of architecture. They represent the University as a world-class institution, but in an understated manner.” Harvard has no glassy campus pond or placid central green, like many universities do. The Yard, which is the closest thing to a traditional campus green, is dotted with buildings. The tight-knit closeness of the University’s structures, the breadth of their styles, the pocket greenery, and the bustling, untamed public square at Harvard’s core make it an unusual campus, one where faculty and students have to interact regularly. In recent decades, buildings are even being designed so their interiors spur academic interaction. The GSD’s Gund Hall, designed by Australian architect and GSD graduate John Andrews and finished in 1972, shows how the University’s pedagogy is enhanced by a building’s design, said Mostafavi, who is also the School’s Alexander and Victoria Wiley Professor of Design. “The hall’s open floor plan provides an extraordinary opportunity for cross-fertilization and collaboration between different disciplines,” he said, “and promotes an unusual degree of interaction, which would be harder to attain within separate enclosed spaces or rooms.” In the northwest corner of campus, construction continues on a new Harvard Law School (HLS) building that will contain multifunctional cluster classrooms with swiveling chairs that will allow for small group chats, or class discussions, or lectures, depending on what’s needed for the teaching at hand. Lately, Harvard also is promoting outdoor interactivity. Last year, a clever campaign energized the Yard. The campaign invited passersby to stop and sit in brightly colored chairs, to have a snack, or to sample the arts. “I believe people respond to the built environment both in terms of the physical design and in relation to how a space is programmed, and the resources afforded to it,’’ said Tanya Iatridis, director of the University Planning Office . “Harvard Yard, the iconic heart of the campus, for all its virtues, does not maximize its potential as simply a place to walk through without stopping.” “Inviting, gathering, and encouraging people to linger by introducing chairs, food kiosks, and arts performances in the Yard, as was carried out through the Common Spaces initiative , transformed daily interactions on the campus,” she said. Over time, the college that was founded on the edge of the American wilderness has adapted to suit its growth and new academic needs. Early on, the campus was a contained group of buildings in a garden setting. Think Massachusetts Hall, which was completed in 1721. In the early 1800s, University Hall broke from tradition when it was built of white granite on a site across from Massachusetts Hall. The new building material was a dramatic departure from the customary brick, and the building’s central location helped to shape future development of the Yard. As the 20th century dawned, Harvard extended its physical reach to the Charles River, where the first undergraduate Houses opened an era of iconic views and public engagement. In the 1950s, Harvard broke from its classical look. Famed architect Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus school, designed the Harvard Graduate Center, now known as Harkness Commons , a cluster of buildings that became the first modernist structure on campus. In 1963, Le Corbusier , another famed architect, added the shock of the modern to Quincy Street, where his Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts opened in counterpoint to the grand, brick Fogg Museum next door. By 1965, the glass and concrete face of GSD Dean Josep Lluis Sert’s 10-story Holyoke Center rose over Harvard Square. A decade ago, Harvard embraced a new ethic of environmental sustainability. Often, the result of that shift has meant refurbishing rather than building. Think the Landmark Center in Boston, a portion of an old Sears Building that the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) converted to modern green standards. Architectural shifts over time Among Harvard’s roughly 660 buildings, Massachusetts Hall is the oldest. Early Georgian in style, its simple construction, symmetry, and modest accents — like its belt course, a row of raised bricks that run along the façade — make it an architectural favorite of many critics. “Never was there a better example of how a simply conceived, plainspoken building of hardly any pretension can achieve a distinction that time and again eludes more elaborately contrived efforts,” wrote Douglass Shand-Tucci, a historian of American art and architecture, in his book “ The Campus Guide: Harvard University .” Massachusetts Hall has been a residence, classroom space, a barracks during the American Revolution, the home of an informal observatory, and the precursor to the modern laboratory (the “Apparatus Chamber” that included equipment acquired by Benjamin Franklin). Today it contains the offices of Harvard’s president and top administrators, with a dormitory for freshmen on its top floor. “This is very unusual cross programming,” said Mostafavi of the hall’s dual function as office and residence. “Because it’s a House, it’s not really a building that represents power. The fact that the president is in a relatively modest building says something about the priorities and the values of the University.” Nearby, Tercentenary Theatre, Harvard’s outdoor arena in the Old Yard that is used for social gatherings and senior send-offs, is bounded by four examples of building diversity: Memorial Church , Sever Hall, University Hall, and the colossal Widener Library . Completed in 1880, Sever Hall is the product of the noted architect and Harvard alumnus Henry Hobson Richardson. Using his bold, Romanesque style, Richardson crafted Sever of red brick, but also incorporated lush ornamentation into his design. “Look at how deep the walls are, the decorations around the windows, and the specially shaped brick, and the building’s texture and shadows, its dramatic roof,” said Alex Krieger, professor in practice of urban design, while touring the Yard. “There’s an incredibly voluptuous quality to it.” Sever faces iconic University Hall, designed by acclaimed architect and Harvard graduate Charles Bulfinch in 1813. His use of white marble in a Colonial Revival and Federal style set it apart. Its placement “established the scale of the Yard and gave it visual coherence,” wrote Bainbridge Bunting in the book “Harvard: An Architectural History,” co-authored with Margaret Henderson Floyd. Instead of facing out toward the adjacent street, “the college now began to develop a spacious academic precinct facing inward, with Bulfinch’s building at its core.” The edges of the Old Yard allow for glimpses of the modern era. Through the centuries, campus planners chose not to fully enclose the Yard like the cloistered designs of their predecessors in England, the universities at Oxford and Cambridge. Instead, the planners left gaps, allowing those passing through to see what Krieger called “a promise of something else.” “You are always walking in a diagonal, you are always seeing the next space beyond,” said Krieger. “Over the tops of these old and venerable buildings, you see the peak of the Science Center or Memorial Hall. It is a wonderful urban design idea. It gives you a sense of what lies beyond.” “What is very special about the Harvard campus for me,” Krieger added, “is that while it has a large, handsome, cherished, and intact historic core — which embodies the ‘Harvard brand,’ it also exhibits the confidence of each generation of its builders, building what seemed appropriate and emblematic for them.” Wedding the old and new Beyond the Yard is a stew of styles and designs, everything from the concrete and glass of the Science Center to the adjacent ornate brick and slate of the High Victorian Gothic Memorial Hall. On the HLS campus, Richardson’s Romanesque Austin Hall sits next to the small Greek Revival Gannett House . At Harvard Divinity School , the Collegiate Gothic-style Andover Hall is across the street from Sert’s Center for the Study of World Religions , designed as a modest residential space with an open courtyard. Increasingly, the University’s construction projects are merging the old and the new. The renovation and expansion of the Harvard Art Museums is an example of that important nexus. Italian architectural luminary Renzo Piano ’s design will unite the Fogg, the Busch-Reisinger, and the Arthur M. Sackler museums in one building. The project will preserve the skeleton of the original 1927 Fogg Museum structure and its beloved interior Calderwood Courtyard. But the new addition will be modern, with a largely wooden exterior. Additional gallery space, classrooms, a lecture hall, and expanded study areas and conservation laboratories in a new glass structure on the roof will increase access to the collections, enhance curatorial collaboration, and broaden the museums’ role in the undergraduate curriculum. Project planners carefully positioned the new addition to the roof so the façade of the building, as viewed from the Yard, will look largely unchanged. “It will be a very handsome and clear presentation of how you can add to an old, venerable building,” said Krieger. Next door, the Carpenter Center, a sweeping circle and square of concrete bisected by a prominent ramp, raised eyebrows and ire when it was built in the 1960s. It is the only building in the nation by Le Corbusier, the working name of revered architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret. While some early critics balked at the placement of such a modern work between the stately Faculty Club and the Fogg, over time the structure has taken on an almost mythic status. Part of the center’s allure, said Elizabeth Padjen, a GSD graduate, is in its ability to act as a counterpoint. “The Carpenter Center introduced a generation to new ideas about modernity and the modern era as a whole,” said Padjen, editor of the quarterly publication of the Boston Society of Architects . “Many people on campus at that time had never seen anything like it. It still serves as a reminder that universities have a special, somewhat complicated responsibility to the culture at large, an obligation to nurture innovation even while they are increasing our understanding of the past.” The man responsible for bringing in Le Corbusier left his own strong modernist mark on Harvard. Using concrete as an expressive material, Sert furthered modernism. The Science Center and Peabody Terrace are his creations, as is the Holyoke Center. Some critics dislike the scale, the contrasts, and the coolness of Sert’s work, but others note that the buildings neatly fill out Sert’s larger vision. “It’s important to note that the Sert buildings were conceived as pieces in the larger master plan that he had developed for the campus,” said Hashim Sarkis, GSD Aga Khan Professor of Landscape Architecture and Urbanism in Muslim Societies. Sert envisioned a campus where educational buildings could become an integral part of the urban environment. The Holyoke Center was developed with that in mind. It is recessed from the street, allowing Harvard Square to have more open space, a feature that was repeated on the other side of the building. The interior ground-floor passageway, a favorite motif for Sert, acts as an urban thoroughfare. Inside and outside the center, shops and restaurants contribute to a lively streetscape. Harvard’s recent architectural past involves other projects lauded by some and criticized by others. Peabody Terrace, the 1960s graduate housing complex along the Charles River, was a University attempt to meld with the community. But some neighbors condemned the project for its scale. Similarly, detractors complained that the contemporary, boxlike dorm across the river at Harvard Business School (HBS) is too big and doesn’t fit their vision of Harvard. Over the years, the University has worked to involve the community in the design process. Time has a way of softening such strong opinions. As decades pass, the styles that seemed overly aggressive or even distasteful in their day can come to be appreciated. In a 1904 letter, author and emeritus Professor Charles Eliot Norton bitterly complained to Harvard’s Board of Overseers about “a long series of failures in the buildings of the University.” “There is, perhaps, not a single University building of the last fifty years, from the Museum of Comparative Zoology to the Memorial Hall … that is likely to be held in admiration one or two generations hence,” Norton wrote. Going green, and collaborating In the new millennium, the University is greening the Crimson campus, with additions ranging from a building heated by underground wells, to wind turbines on rooftops, to solar panels attached to dormitories. Rising along Massachusetts Avenue is the University’s newest building, which will serve as a Law School student center, classrooms, and clinical space. Project planners expect to win LEED Gold Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council . Designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects , the building also incorporates some design elements familiar to the HLS campus, including a color similar to that of Langdell Hall and prominent arches reminiscent of Austin Hall. With its green-building efficiencies, inventive classroom concepts, and a design that is modern but includes influences from the past, the building suggests an important future architectural direction for Harvard. There have been architectural shifts beyond the main campus as well. In 1999 the Harvard School of Public Health wanted to expand in the Longwood Medical Area of Boston, but space was lacking. So when some opened in the nearby Landmark Center, a large art deco building built in 1929, the School took over more than 40,000 square feet of office space, and turned it into the University’s first sustainable building effort. A third repurposed site signals a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach. At HBS, in a building that was once the home of public broadcaster WGBH , plans are under way for a new type of laboratory. The Harvard Innovation Lab will serve as a University-wide resource for students and faculty eager to tap into Harvard’s entrepreneurial spirit. “We are trying to achieve a new model of collaboration for Harvard. Here, students and faculty from all across the University can meet others who share an innovative streak, who are interested in getting projects off the ground,” said Sharon Black, HBS director of planning. The lab will include a mix of innovation-oriented and social enterprise projects, as well as services geared toward small businesses and entrepreneurs in the surrounding community. “The future intellectual direction of Harvard will be linked to its physical planning and architectural path,” Mostafavi said. “When there is more and more discussion around collaboration and transdisciplinary practices, the question is: What kind of space do you need for that work?” he added. “New kinds of research means new kinds of juxtapositions, and will require certain negotiations between schools. It will be important to explore how buildings and architecture can help set the stage for these future collaborations.”
