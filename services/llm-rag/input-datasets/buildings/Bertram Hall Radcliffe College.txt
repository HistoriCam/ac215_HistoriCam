Bertram Hall at Radcliffe College is an historic dormitory building on the Radcliffe Quadrangle of Harvard University at 53 Shepard Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts . Built in 1901, it was the first dormitory building constructed for Radcliffe College . The building is now one of the dormitories of Harvard's Cabot House . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Bertram Hall is located on the south side of the Radcliffe Quadrangle, between its grassy center and Shepard Street. It is a 3 + 1 ⁄ 2 -story brick building with Georgian Revival styling. It is covered by a dormered hip roof. It is nine bays wide, with a central five-bay section and symmetrical two-bay end sections that project slightly. The building corners have brick quoining, and the eave is adorned with modillions. Most windows are set in rectangular openings with stone sills and splayed stone lintels; those on the ground floors of the end sections are set in blind round-arch recesses. The main entrance is at the center, sheltered by a single-story porch with Tuscan columns and a balustrade on the roof. The hall was built in 1901 to a design by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow Jr. It was the first of the quadrangle's buildings to be built, and the first dormitory building at Radcliffe College , representing a major shift in the college's policy from placement of its boarding students in private homes. It was funded by a donation from the Radcliffe class of 1895. It was named after John Bertram Kimball, the deceased eight year old son of David Pulsifer Kimball and Clara Millet Bertram Kimball, and the grandson of Captain John Bertram .

Photo by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Rose Lincoln and Stephanie Mitchell Harvard Staff Photographers Most academic institutions have dormitories or residence halls. Harvard has Houses. The House system, established in 1930 by Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, was fashioned after the residences at Oxford and Cambridge. Lowell aimed to embed the educational experience into the Houses. His aim was for undergraduates to develop wider circles of friends and for House administrators and tutors to support student needs; each House was designed with a dining hall, library, and senior and junior common rooms for study, meetings, and collaboration. The House system, composed of nine River Houses, three Quad Houses, and one alternative residence, has been at the center of the undergraduate experience. Lining or near the Charles River are Adams, Dunster, Eliot, Kirkland, Leverett, Lowell, Mather, Quincy, and Winthrop. Situated north of Harvard Square around the Radcliffe Quadrangle are Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer. And nestled in the neighborhood north of campus is the Dudley Co-op. House architecture is as varied as the residents who inhabit them. From the neo-Georgian to the Brutalist, each has its own flourishes and charm that make these Houses home. On Friday, Housing Day, first-year students will find out which House they will live in for the rest of their time at Harvard. The golden gate clasp as you enter Adams from Plympton Street. Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer In the seven residential halls that make up Adams House, Faculty Dean Sean Palfrey wrote, “There are nooks and crannies everywhere, though even more so inside where there are gold-leaf-walled rooms, arches, organs, stained glass, Moorish ceilings, marble floors.” Currently, Adams House is under renovation. It is a project that will take five years and aims to “keep Adams weird.” A faced carved in stone greets visitors at Randolph Hall’s Westmorly Court entrance, one of the many quirks beloved to Adams. A puppy play group gathers in open space facing Cabot House. Faculty Dean Ian Miller describes the area as “fun, informal, and full of adorable creatures great and small.” Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer “Lots and lots of open space often filled with kids and dogs and neighbors and just lots of laidback fun,” said Ian Miller, faculty dean of Cabot House, one of the three Houses that make up the Quad. “The Quad is really unusual. All of the other Houses are gated communities. Cabot is open to the world and open to Cambridge, and that is in many ways what defines our House ethos: Semper Cor, or ‘always heart.’ We lead with kindness, care, and creativity — and we endeavor to be open to the world.” Red and gold, the Cabot colors, are celebrated on the tower and an entrance. Cabot House, which was formed in 1970, is comprised of six brick halls that surround the grassy Radcliffe Quadrangle: Cabot (1937), Whitman (1912), Briggs (1923), Barnard (1932), Bertram (1901), and Eliot (1906).

Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Of all Harvard’s undergraduate Houses, no building brings the outdoors inside like Currier. “The tree house” is all about the landscape where alternate sloping and sunken hillsides are organic, serene, and tree-filled. Frank Lloyd Wright would approve of Currier. In the common room called “the fishbowl” there are oversized windows that face the slopes. On a winter day this space transforms to feel more like a snow globe than a fishbowl. The classic 19th-century homes blend seamlessly into the residential neighborhood, with the exception of the enigmatic, hand-painted sign above one entrance that reads “Center for High Energy Metaphysics.” Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Two Victorian homes nestled between Harvard and Porter squares comprise the Dudley Co-op. Founded in 1958, the Co-op offers an alternative to on-campus living with its “progressive, participatory community.” The structures, one on Massachusetts Avenue and the other on Sacramento Street, mingle well in the Cambridge community. The Dunster House Tower was inspired by Christopher Wren’s Tom Tower (1681) at Oxford’s Christ Church. Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer A small triangular plot along the Charles River is the site of Dunster House, named after Henry Dunster, the first president of Harvard (1640‒1654). The large-scale, heavy, and elaborate adornments harken back to 18th-century Baroque English architecture. Dunster’s wrought-iron gates stylistically echo the Yard. A three-moose shield has marked the entrance since the House was renewed in 2014. “The cupola with green dome is among the loveliest on campus. As lovely as the library and dining hall undoubtedly are, the spectacular red-brick exterior, spread out along the river, makes it one of the most beautiful buildings not only at Harvard but in the country,” Faculty Dean Kevin Madigan said, proudly citing Eliot House’s third-place ranking in Architectural Digest’s list of the most beautiful college residences in America. Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer “There is a reason so many films have featured Eliot from the air,” said Faculty Dean of Eliot House Kevin Madigan. “To start with, it is spectacularly situated on the river, and the architects neatly fit it between JFK and Memorial Drive. Its near-perfection, architecturally speaking, is that is it a single building that essentially makes up an equilateral triangle, sun-drenched and opening onto a view of the river.” The arched entranceway resonates with the embedded shell design of the surrounding gate. Kirkland is the only River House with a twin-chimneyed gable connected by a horizontal parapet bridge. The distinguishing feature matches Massachusetts Hall, the oldest surviving building at Harvard, which houses the president and administrative offices. A sundial painted with the Harvard motto Veritas decorates the south wall of Smith Hall. Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Kirkland House, named for the Rev. John Thornton Kirkland, Class of 1789, who served as president of Harvard from 1810 to 1828, is composed of three primary structures: Smith Hall (1913), the main residence quad; Bryan Hall (1931), the Faculty Dean’s lodging; and John Hicks House (1760), the site of the House library. Among the smallest Houses, the intimate structure is steeped in classic charm and refinement, with high ceilings and intricate woodwork. Faculty Dean David Deming said, “We are a small but mighty House, and having everyone packed into one space really does make it feel like a close-knit community.” The Leverett Towers complex of 1959‒60 occupies a prominent location just off the intersection of Memorial Drive and DeWolfe Street. Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer The 12 stories of Leverett Towers (1960) were erected as an adjunct to Leverett’s existing McKinlock Hall (1925) on nearby Memorial Drive. This was Harvard’s first experiment with high-rise design and differed greatly from the neo-Georgian style farther up the river. The central garden is depressed and the towers are asymmetrical. The towers and the elevated library form a natural courtyard and stage, and thus a Commencement ceremony space as well. Black wrought-iron detail in a Lowell gate that faces Mount Auburn Street. Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell (1909‒1933) hired his close friend Charles Coolidge to design the River Houses. Coolidge initially wanted to create a Gothic Revival grouping; his partners had to convene a meeting of Boston architects to talk him out of it. Today the River Houses, including Lowell, are considered a masterwork of Georgian Revival design and are central to the feel of Harvard’s landscape. Lowell House, specifically, was praised by historian Walter Muir Whitehill as a “masterpiece of creative eclecticism.” Lowell House was built on a knoll where the first settlers of Cambridge had planned to build their fort. A Danilov Russian bell is on display in one of Lowell’s courtyards. The Mather House clock was given in memory of Francis Skiddy von Stade, Class of 1907. Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Mather House, a 19-story high-rise built in 1970, was designed by Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbott, the oldest architectural firm in Boston and the one that designed all of Harvard’s River Houses. Mather’s brutalist style is showcased in the rigid geometry. Enormous concrete pillars decorate open patio spaces. A closer look at the clock and the view up at Mather’s 19 stories from the sunken courtyard. “[There’s a] kind of secret garden, planted with a few rather majestic trees — the faculty row courtyard, where children play, and we hold our graduation ceremonies in May” said Faculty Dean Anne Harrington. “We couldn’t imagine living anywhere else.” Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Pforzheimer, or PfoHo, as it’s known pfar and wide, is farthest north of all of Harvard’s undergraduate Houses; thus its polar bear mascot. Central in the horseshoe-shaped Radcliffe Quadrangle, with its wide and expansive lawn, is the well-proportioned and impressive Moors Hall, PfoHo’s showpiece. Inside Moors is a double-decker dining hall. The crow’s nest inside the bell tower at Pforzheimer gives views of Boston on all four sides of the lantern, and the lights can be programmed to shine in a kaleidoscope of colors. Under the crow’s nest is the sought-after bell tower suite. The American Institute of Architects selected the faculty row townhouses project for a 1973 honor. The boxy, modernist side of Quincy House, right, was added in 1958; while Stone Hall, previously called Old Quincy, dates back to 1930, and was part of the building boom under President Lowell. Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Faculty Deans Eric Beerbohm and Leslie Duhaylongsod like to say that Quincy — “the people’s house” — lives up to its name even in its hybrid look. “Our inclusiveness starts with its two structures — the superb joining of Stone Hall’s neo-Georgian with New Quincy’s boxy modernism,” Beerbohm said. According to architect Bainbridge Bunting, (new) Quincy House showed the designers’ efforts to give international style an American form. They substituted Harvard red brick with white stucco and used limestone trim along with varied window designs. The organization of Quincy House around a courtyard, however, follows traditional Harvard guidelines. Rather than use colonial designs, Winthrop House opted for more opulent English embellishments. Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Winthrop House, with its three river-facing courtyards, is an arresting site for walkers along the Charles. The three main structures are Gore and Standish halls (1913), similar in size, and the Beren Hall (2017). Wrought-iron gates link the buildings with elaborate “G” and “S” designs marking the entrances. “One feature of Winthrop that we especially like is that Kaneb Courtyard (between Gore and Standish halls) is open to all,” said Faculty Deans Stephen Chong and Kiran Gajwani. “Harvard students, staff, and members of the public pass through this beautiful space as they go to and from the river. It’s a great metaphor for Winthrop being welcoming and open.”

Title: Enter to grow in wisdom

Ken Gewertz Harvard News Office A tour of Harvard’s gates (Flash 7 required: click to download ) From the perspective of Harvard’s 369-year history, the gates in and around the campus are a relatively new phenomenon. For more than two-thirds of its existence, Harvard had nothing more to guard its perimeter than a low post-and-beam fence. When the Johnston Gate – the initial component of the present-day enclosure – went up in 1889, many decried its towering piers and elaborate ironwork as a pretentious imposition on the school’s austere Puritan heritage. But as time went on and succeeding Harvard classes raised generous sums to extend the fence and punctuate it with stately apertures, the structure grew to be as familiar and beloved as any of the school’s more venerable monuments. If anything, the gates have become such fixtures in the Harvard landscape that they verge on invisibility. To hurried, preoccupied pedestrians, their details and decorations fade and blur, their inscriptions go unread. They are reduced to mere function, a passageway from the Yard to the street, from the street to the Yard. Of course, that is essentially what a gate is. But the Harvard gates are more than that. Each has its own story to tell – some simple and straightforward, others complex and ambiguous, some embodying the notions and values of another age, others enshrining the ideals and aspirations of today. This Web page is dedicated to telling some of those stories, in the hope of enriching the experience of all those who walk through these portals, whether for the first time or the thousandth. When it was completed in 1889, Johnston Gate stood alone. The other gates and even the brick and iron fence that now encloses the Yard were still in the future. And while nothing quite as grand as its delicate ironwork and massive brick and sandstone piers had ever graced the spot before, the location of the gate has served as the Yard’s main entrance since the end of the 17th century. The gate is named for Samuel Johnston, Class of 1855, who left Harvard $10,000 for its construction. A resident of Chicago, Johnston is described in his 1886 obituary as a bachelor and a “well-known capitalist,” and by a fellow member of the Chicago Club as “a short, ruddy faced bon-vivant.” A book of reminiscences by one of Johnston’s neighbors describes him drinking a toast on the front steps of his house as the Chicago fire blazed nearby. Designed by the Boston architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White, Johnston Gate was the first example at Harvard of Colonial Revival, a style that, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries became almost standard for Harvard buildings. Built of salvaged bricks chosen for their varied texture and color, the structure also helped to popularize what has come to be known in the building trade as “Harvard water-struck brick,” used on most Harvard buildings since that time. The gate bears two plaques inscribed with the earliest records of Harvard’s founding, an inscription from “New England’s First Fruits” (1643) and the records of the General Court of Massachusetts Bay establishing the College. Completed in 1900, the 1874 Gate was closed in 1926 after the building of Lionel Hall, the freshman dorm that now blocks the entrance. The 1886 Gate, finished in 1901, was also closed in 1926 after Mower Hall was constructed. The 1870 Gate stands between the two dormitories, Lionel and Mower, facing the back of Appleton Chapel. Between the chapel and the gate is a sundial, and around its vase-shaped stone base are inscribed the words “On this moment hangs eternity.” However, since most of the Roman numerals on the sundial’s face have worn away, precisely which moment eternity is hanging on is now hard to determine. The 1870 Gate’s ironwork was in unusually bad shape when the restoration of the Harvard Yard fence was undertaken in the early 1990s. Now that it has been repaired and repainted, conservationists predict that along with the rest of the fence it will last another 100 years. Nevertheless, because it does not lead directly into the main part of the Yard, it is usually kept padlocked. The 1881 Gate, erected in 1905, serves as the principal entrance to Phillips Brooks House, which houses the Phillips Brooks House Association (PBHA), coordinating nearly 80 student-run public service programs. The building was named for Phillips Brooks (1835-1893), a renowned preacher, minister of Trinity Church in Boston, and author of the hymn “O Little Town of Bethlehem” – hence the cross that surmounts the gate’s ironwork structure and the New Testament quotation (“Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make ye free,” John 8:32). It is one of the few gates not designed by Charles F. McKim. The designer was Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow Jr., nephew of the poet and a member of the architectural firm Longfellow, Alden & Harlow. Longfellow also designed Bertram and Eliot Halls in the Quadrangle and the third-floor library of Fay House in Radcliffe Yard. Stylistically, the gate is entirely in keeping with McKim’s Colonial Revival designs. The 1876 Gate, aka Holworthy, is located just to the northwest of Holworthy Hall, a freshman dorm. Both gate and hall were named for Sir Matthew Holworthy, an English merchant, whose bequest of £1,000 in 1678 was the largest single gift to Harvard in the 17th century. The gate is on an axis with the 1857 Gate, leading pedestrians through the Yard, across Pusey Plaza to the Science Center, and beyond. An inscription above the gate leaves no doubt when it was dedicated: “Given by the Class of 1876 on Commencement Day 1901.” The opposite side of the shield bears the inscription “In memory of dear old times.” The quotation is from “The Ballad of the Bouillabaisse” by William Makepeace Thackeray, in which the poet returns to a Parisian inn to sample the famous Mediterranean fish stew (accompanied by a bottle of good burgundy) that sustained him and his fellows in their youth: I drink it as the Fates ordain it. Come; fill it and have done with rhymes; Fill up the lonely glass and drain it In memory of dear old times. The Meyer Gate, erected in 1901, is named for George von Lengerke Meyer, Class of 1879, who paid for its construction. Born in Boston in 1858, Meyer held positions in state and local government while also managing his business affairs. He later served as ambassador to Italy and Russia and was appointed postmaster general in 1907 by Theodore Roosevelt. In 1909, President Taft named him secretary of the Navy, a post he held until 1913. He is credited with making the Navy more efficient and with proving the feasibility of carrier-based aviation. Under his jurisdiction, pilot Eugene Ely successfully took off and landed from temporary platforms erected over the decks of Navy cruisers. Meyer died in 1919. A massive brick structure with deep side wings, the gate comprises a wide center opening for carriages and two arched foot gates. It was designed by Charles F. McKim, who was Meyer’s brother-in-law. Matching stone plaques grace the tall brick piers. The one on the right bears a veritas shield. On the left is a carving, partly weathered, of a pelican feeding her young. According to legend, the female pelican in times of famine would peck at her own breast and feed her young with her blood. The bird thus came to represent self-sacrifice and was considered a symbol for Christ. An inscription surrounding the carving gives Meyer’s name and records in Latin, the fact that he was a Bostonian and a member of the Class of 1879. In addition, there is a phrase in German, “Furchtlos und Treu” (fearless and true), which is also the motto of the kingdom of Württemburg as well as the title of a German marching tune. Harvard’s newest gate honors the first published poet of the American Colonies, Anne Dudley Bradstreet (1612-1672). Arriving as a young newlywed in Salem harbor in 1630, Bradstreet found time to write poetry while leading the hard and demanding life of a Puritan pioneer. Her collection of poems, “The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America” appeared in London in 1650 and was a great success. Bradstreet lived in what is now Harvard Square, and her home is believed to have stood on the spot now occupied by Citizen’s Bank. Her associations with Harvard College were many. Her father, Thomas Dudley, was governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and one of the original Harvard overseers. Her husband, Simon Bradstreet, also became governor of Massachusetts Bay and was an overseer of Harvard College. Among their children were Samuel, Class of 1653, and Simon, Class of 1660. The Bradstreet Gate and adjoining fence replaced a section of chain-link fence that had stood since the construction of Canaday Hall in 1974. Designed by architect Michael S. Teller, the gate was installed in 1995 as part of a multiyear effort to restore and complete the brick and ironwork fence enclosing Harvard Yard. It was dedicated on Oct. 4, 1997, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of women living in Yard dormitories. A plaque is inscribed with a quotation from Bradstreet: “I came into this Country, where I found a new World and new manners at which my heart rose.” The grand semicircular sweep of the double 1887 and 1888 gates, separated by a stone lion’s head spouting water into a granite basin, comes as something of a surprise to pedestrians traveling the curving brick walkway that connects Pusey Plaza with Quincy Street. The gate seems too imposing for its location. The railing that protects walkers from tumbling to the busy street below ensures that one cannot get far enough away from the structure to appreciate its scope, and the view from either gate is blocked by the back of Canaday, the Yard’s newest dorm. The explanation lies in the fact that when the gates were erected in 1906, the appearance of the Yard and environs was considerably different. In place of Canaday, built in 1974, stood the more compact Hunt Hall, the original Fogg Museum. The gate on the right led past this building toward the transept entrance of the Memorial Church, while the left hand gate led directly to Sever Hall. And in those pre-underpass days, Broadway, a quiet street populated mostly by horse-drawn vehicles and an occasional trolley, was still on a level with the Yard. The Robinson Gate is one of two gates given by the Class of 1908, the other being the larger, more impressive Eliot Gate. The Robinson Gate leads to a basement entrance of Robinson Hall, a building that was constructed in 1904 to house the School of Architecture and is now home to the History Department. Built in 1936, the Robinson Gate was designed by Richmond Knapp Fletcher (1885-1965), Class of 1908. A portrait painter as well as an architect, Fletcher also composed several fight songs still in the repertoire of the Harvard Band, among them “Yo-Ho! (the good ship Harvard)” and “Gridiron King.” The 1885 Gate, erected in 1904, faces west toward the rear entrance of Sever Hall and east toward the main entrance of the Fogg Museum, straddling the axis that connects the two buildings. Designed by Charles F. McKim, the gate features a pair of carved stone urns with ram heads atop its two brick piers. Another gate designed by the multitalented Richmond Knapp Fletcher ’08. A simple foot gate erected in 1936, it provides access to Emerson Hall, which houses the Philosophy Department. Grandest of the four gates designed by R.K. Fletcher, the Eliot Gate commemorates Charles William Eliot (1834-1926), president of Harvard from 1869 to 1909, the longest presidency in the University’s history. Given by the Class of 1908, this vehicle gate was designed to provide a driveway entrance to 17 Quincy St., which served as the president’s house until 1971. This was the year that the new president, Derek Bok, seeking greater privacy for his family, decided to move his residence to Elmwood, the former residence of poet James Russell Lowell. Bok thus became the first Harvard president to live outside Harvard Yard. The house that he abandoned is now the headquarters of the Office of the Governing Boards, and its dining hall is still used for formal occasions. The gate’s brick piers bear two plaques. The one on the left reads, “In memory of Charles William Eliot, 1834-1926, given by the Class of 1908.” The one on the right is inscribed with a quotation from a biography of Eliot: “He opened paths for our children’s feet to follow. Something of him will be a part of us forever.” The gate leading to the main entrance of 17 Quincy St. is another gift of the Class of 1908 and was designed by R.K. Fletcher, a member of that class. Erected in 1936, it is a small foot gate whose simple ironwork arch, low enough for a tall person to reach up and touch, conveys an impression of intimacy that fits well with the modest leafy brick path lined with perennial borders. This gate is easy to miss, since the drive to which it once provided an entrance no longer exists. In its place is a lawn whose center of interest is a large bronze sculpture by British artist Henry Moore. The gate is permanently closed. Don’t look for the Dudley Gate. It was demolished some time around 1947 to make way for Lamont Library. And while not on the same scale as other vanished architectural wonders like the Colossus of Rhodes or Pennsylvania Station, it nevertheless continues to exert a certain fascination for students of Harvardiana. Erected in 1915 for the then-magnificent sum of $25,000, the Dudley Gate was given by Caroline Phelps Stokes, who bequeathed the money to her nephew Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, Class of 1891, with the understanding that he would use the funds to build a monument to her ancestor Thomas Dudley (1576-1653), governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Stokes, an architect of the firm Howells & Stokes, designed an impressive brick and limestone structure that included a clock tower more than 30 feet high with a full-length bas-relief of Dudley on one side and a long inscription on the other detailing the governor’s history and accomplishments. The inscription is the only part of the structure that remains. It has been incorporated into the Dudley Garden, a leafy retreat between the south side of Lamont and the section of tall brick fence fronting Massachusetts Avenue. The Lamont Gate was designed by Henry Richardson Shepley ’10 of Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch & Abbott. It provides access to Lamont Library from Quincy Street and was erected between 1947 and 1949, coinciding with the building of Lamont. A relatively simple gate, it faces the larger, more elaborate Hallowell Gate across Quincy Street. The Hallowell Gate is the entranceway to the Barker Center, formerly the Freshman Union. A wrought-iron gate across the rear delivery entrance of Lamont Library. The 1880 Gate used to be called the Stone Gate, and indeed it is the only gate constructed almost entirely of white limestone. It looks into the Dudley Garden, although the view is partially blocked by a brick wall, on the other side of which is the lengthy inscription salvaged from the Dudley Gate. No can one enter the garden through the gate because it is nearly always locked. Access to the garden is through a gate inside the Yard. Erected in 1902 and designed by Charles F. McKim, the gate was paid for principally by Robert Bacon, Class of 1880. Bacon (1860-1919), whose name is engraved on a limestone panel to the left of the gate, was born in Jamaica Plain, Mass., and was a partner with the banking firm J.P. Morgan and Co. He served as United States secretary of state in 1909 and as ambassador to France, 1909-1912. Erected in 1901 and designed by Charles F. McKim, the 1890 Gate was a gift of Mrs. Wirt Dexter in memory of her son Samuel Dexter, Class of 1890, who died in 1894. The gate leads into one of the arched passageways that cut through Wigglesworth. Two inscriptions by Harvard President Charles William Eliot adorn the gate itself: on the outside, “Enter to grow in wisdom”; on the inside, “Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” Designed by Charles F. McKim, the gate was a gift from Edwin D. Morgan, Class of 1877. A relative by marriage of the financier J.P. Morgan, Edwin was immensely wealthy in his own right. He shared J.P. Morgan’s enthusiasm for ocean racing, serving as commodore of the New York Yacht Club from 1893 to 1894. In partnership with the renowned yacht designer Nathanael Greene Herreshoff, Morgan competed successfully in a number of important sailing races including the America’s Cup. Described by one writer as a man who would think “no more of buying a yacht than the average man does of picking up a paper as he passes a newsstand,” Morgan owned some 17 vessels including steamers, schooners, sloops, America’s Cup Defenders, and many smaller yachts. Similar in style to the Dexter Gate, with piers composed of alternating layers of brick and limestone, giving it a vaguely Moorish air, the 1889 Gate provides access to another arched passageway through Wigglesworth. It was designed by Charles F. McKim and dedicated at Commencement 1901. Look up at the keystone of the tall, arched Porcellian Gate and you will see a limestone carving of a boar’s head (there’s one on the other side, too). Why this porcine portrait? For an explanation, look across the street at 1324 Massachusetts Ave. The unassuming brick building, whose ground floor houses the clothing shop J. August, is the headquarters of the Porcellian Club, the oldest and most exclusive “final” club at Harvard (note the boar’s head in profile over the doorway). Final in this sense means once you’re in, you can’t join another one, and membership is for life. Only members are allowed inside the club, and the perpetually drawn shades ensure that outsiders can’t even sneak a peek at the interior (which is reputed to have changed very little in the club’s 200-plus years). The only exceptions to this rule were Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower, but this honor was on a one-time-only basis; when Ike asked if he could come back a second time he was refused. The list of Porcellian members includes architect H.H. Richardson, Civil War hero Robert Gould Shaw (leader of the black 54th Regiment), Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, President Theodore Roosevelt (his younger cousin FDR was rejected), and writer George Plimpton. The Porcellian began when an undergraduate named Joseph McKean, Class of 1794, served a group of friends a dinner of roast pig. The original name, the Pig Club, was soon changed to the more genteel, latinate Porcellian. The gate is also known as the McKean Gate in honor of the club’s founder, who later served (1808-1818) as the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory. The Porcellian Club donated the money to build the gate, which was completed in 1901. The Class of 1857 Gate, completed in 1901, is the only gate in Harvard Yard with three archways, all of them designed exclusively for pedestrian use. Two elegant wrought-iron lanterns flank the center opening. On the left side of the gate is a tablet commemorating the two houses located on the edge of Cowyard Row that housed Harvard College in its first years of existence. These were the Peyntree House, occupied by Harvard’s less than successful first master Nathaniel Eaton, and the Goffe House, which served as a dormitory. Their foundations were discovered when Massachusetts Avenue was torn up in 1910 to build the Red Line. Two tablets above the gate’s outer archways bear a Latin inscription from one of Horace’s Odes. The translation reads, “Thrice happy and more are they whom an unbroken band unites, and whom no sundering of love by wretched quarrels shall separate before life’s dying day.” Surmounted by a veritas shield, the 1875 Gate bears on its entablature a quotation from Isaiah (26:2): “Open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.” Its designer, Charles F. McKim of the Boston architectural firm McKim, Mead & White, may have had in mind a symbolic union of the two great sources of Western civilization – Hebrew and Greek – when he chose to combine the words of the prophet with an emphatically classical style of architecture. Two Doric columns frame the gate. As a student at École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, McKim would have had a thorough grounding in the history and meaning of the architectural orders and would have known that the plain, sturdy Doric is considered masculine in style and appropriate to structures with military connotations. In 1900, when the gate was built, Harvard was still an intensely male place, and perhaps McKim envisioned the gate as an invitation to young men to take on the rigorous intellectual, moral, and physical training that would prepare them to soldier on through the vicissitudes of life. Another interesting thing about the 1875 Gate is that when Strauss Hall was built in 1926, the gate was moved 50 feet to the south.
