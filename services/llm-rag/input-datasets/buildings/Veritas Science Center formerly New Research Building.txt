Lauren M. Marshall and B.D. Colen Harvard News Office The University’s plans for a 21st century extension of its campus in Allston took more definite shape this year with the selection of a site and architect for a half-million-square-foot science complex, as well as the announcement of plans for new arts and culture facilities. These first steps, taken after three years of extensive planning and consultation within the University, with the city of Boston, and with the surrounding communities, are the beginning of a multi-decade process to imagine and build in Allston the educational, research, and residential facilities necessary for Harvard to advance knowledge and maintain academic leadership into the next century. “It’s very encouraging to see that plans for Harvard’s properties in Allston, while still in the early stages, have become much more tangible in recent months. Sites have been identified for a new science complex as well as interim arts and culture spaces, and we anticipate additional forward movement in the months ahead,” said Jamie Houghton, senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation. “Our ultimate goal in Allston is to strengthen Harvard’s long-term capacity to generate exciting new knowledge and ideas and to educate the very best students of each generation. The progress we have made this year brings us appreciably closer to that goal, and I’m grateful to all those who have played a part.” • Allston Interim Report 2005 • Faculty task force makes University science recommendations • Allston Progress report of faculty task forces 2004 • More information on the Harvard in Allston Exhibit Room • More information on Allston planning Also in this issue: • Stefan Behnisch explores Harvard’s architectural past and present, and considers the future In addition to announcing its first projects this year, Harvard established a public display to share preliminary ideas for Harvard’s future in Allston; held forums to solicit feedback and discuss concerns of faculty, students, staff, alumni, and Allston residents; and created the Allston Development Group to oversee planning for, and ultimately the building of this new dimension of Harvard’s campus. Christopher M. Gordon, chief operating officer of the Allston Development Group and former director of the $4.4 billion Logan Modernization Project for the Massachusetts Port Authority, describes the accomplishments of 2005-06 as having established a foundation for Harvard’s future in Allston. “When I arrived at Harvard, I discovered a solid foundation of planning for the Allston Initiative,” said Gordon. “President Summers’ vision and leadership and the thoughtful input we’ve received from the Harvard and Allston communities have made it possible for the University to begin to realize ideas that have evolved over nearly a decade.” Over the coming year, the University will refine its thinking about the programmatic elements of the extended campus with a goal of developing a comprehensive, yet flexible, 50-year master plan for Allston. According to Gordon, Harvard’s planning team expects to complete the plan – a framework with future building locations, street and block patterns, new open spaces, better riverfront access, and transportation improvements – in the next year with additional input from all corners of the University community and beyond. Said incoming interim President Derek Bok, “The year ahead promises to be one of progress as the University’s planners, in consultation with the Harvard community and our neighbors, continue their efforts to help shape and strengthen Harvard for decades to come.” Recognizing the importance of broad consultation, leaders of the Allston planning process have made a point of soliciting input from a wide range of groups. To that end, the University opened the “Harvard in Allston” exhibit room in the Holyoke Center arcade in October 2005. The Allston Room , as the exhibit has become known, displays preliminary ideas and possibilities for Harvard in Allston identified by Harvard’s planning consultants, the Cooper, Roberston, Gehry, Olin collaboration – ideas being considered as part of Harvard’s 50-year Allston master plan. The exhibit has drawn more than 2,000 visitors, including members of the Harvard community and residents of the city of Boston and surrounding neighborhoods. Harvard’s planning team also solicited the ideas and opinions of Allston residents and Harvard faculty, staff, students, and alumni through a variety of other forums. The President’s Advisory Committee on the Allston Initiative, a group of Harvard alumni and friends led by Robert M. Bass and Penny S. Pritzker (A.B. ’81) – many of whom are experts in urban planning, design, and development – met regularly this year to advise the president and the Allston Development Group on planning. At a workshop run by Project for Public Spaces, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating and sustaining public places, 50 Allston residents discussed ways the surrounding community could benefit from a future campus and proposed ideas like outdoor meeting places, parks, play areas, fountains, cafes, restaurants, and possibly a farmers’ market. Harvard and the Allston community task force appointed by the mayor in December 2005 are also meeting regularly to discuss these and other ideas. “The feedback we have received and will continue to solicit is a critical part of the iterative process of planning,” said Kathy Spiegelman, chief planner for the Allston Initiative. “These comments are helping us sharpen ideas, identify key issues, and, ultimately, will help us realize a successful long-term vision for Harvard in Allston that will serve generations.” As thinking about Harvard’s future in Allston progressed, science and the need for facilities to accommodate new ways of approaching scientific research and exploration emerged as a University priority. “When considering the history of our scientific enterprise – of any scientific enterprise – what quickly becomes clear is the difficulty of predicting, and preparing for, future needs,” said Harvard Provost Steven E. Hyman. “There is simply no more room left in Cambridge for the long-term growth of interdisciplinary science,” he said, “so if we are to grow, and we must, and remain nimble, it will have to be in Allston.” Hyman pointed out that fields of science change over time, and noted that facilities have to be flexible. “We need to design facilities that can accommodate changing needs, that can be used for one form of investigation for a period of years, and then can be adapted for another use,” he said. Last winter, at the request of Harvard’s science deans, Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers appointed a broadly based Science Planning Committee, including representatives of science departments and Schools across the University, to build on the long-range Allston science planning done by Harvard faculty to date. “The important thing is that this is an effort to ensure that Harvard will be the best place in the world to do science,” said Andrew Murray, Herchel Smith Professor of Molecular Genetics, director of the Bauer Center for Genomics Research, and one of the co-chairs of the committee. “And it’s an effort to do that by broadly representing the faculty in eliciting good ideas about areas to grow science and engineering over the next 10 to 20 to 30 years. Larry Summers said he wanted us to have an impact so that his successor’s successor would be grateful to us.” “Science is going to be distributed across the North Yard in Cambridge, Allston, and Longwood; the idea is to get as much input from people and weld it into a coherent plan,” Murray continued. Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences, and Science Planning Committee member, said, “When changes occur in science, they do so more rapidly than in other disciplines. The University needs to plan for the scientific future in a way that allows it to be as nimble as possible. Any plan for the future of Allston science must be integrated with planning for science on what will be the University’s three centers of science.” Harvard is committed to sustainable planning, green building design and sustainable campus operations, such as running its entire diesel fleet with biodiesel.

(Staff file photo Rose Lincoln/Harvard News Office) The need to foster that integration – and the pressing need for a home for the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, where scientists can work side by side sharing findings and approaches that may apply to different organ systems – led to the University’s first Allston projects, announced in February. At that time, Harvard selected the architectural firm Behnisch Architekten of Stuttgart, Germany, to design a state-of-the-art science complex in Allston, south of Western Avenue near the Harvard Business School. The announcement was embraced by the mayor of Boston. “The construction of this 21st century campus in Boston will have a positive transforming effect upon the Allston neighborhood and the city, strengthening the position of Boston as the life sciences capital of the world and increasing the capacity of our economic engine,” said Mayor Thomas M. Menino. At the time of the science announcement, Harvard also unveiled plans for interim arts and cultural spaces to be created in Allston, including a new visual arts center on Soldiers Field Road. Menino noted that the coming arts and culture facilities would “not only enrich and inspire students and faculty, but also neighborhood residents as well.” In May 2006, the Harvard University Art Museums announced the selection of Daly Genik Architects of Los Angeles to design the visual arts center. The center, which would enable the renovation of the Art Museums’ facilities in Cambridge and serve Harvard students and the public, marked just the beginning of the University’s arts and culture presence in Allston. Charting the course for arts and culture in Allston was the mission of a committee of arts and culture faculty, museum directors, and arts leaders convened in the fall. The committee met throughout the year to consider Harvard’s needs as well as what would be required to make Allston a culturally vital campus for students, faculty, and neighbors. In the coming year, the group will engage additional faculty members and other constituencies in discussions to further refine Allston arts and culture plans. “The Arts and Culture Steering Committee has been a marvelous forum for imagining communities, both for Harvard and for Allston and the greater Boston area. While most of us have thought of our respective pursuits in terms of the academic and extracurricular needs of our own students and faculty, it is inspiring to think of ways in which Harvard can share what it knows and does about culture and the arts of the world with the larger community,” said William Fash, Bowditch Professor of Central American and Mexican Archaeology and Ethnology, Howells Director of the Peabody Museum, and a member of the arts and culture task force. “We have had fun and quite a few challenges envisioning the ways in which culture and the arts at Harvard can ‘act locally’ while thinking and working globally,” Fash added. While science and arts and culture planning advanced this year, Harvard’s School of Public Health and the Harvard Graduate School of Education continued their own academic planning and assessment of the opportunities and challenges offered by a prospective relocation to Allston. One school already in Allston welcomes the presence of new academic neighbors. “Harvard’s expanded presence in Allston is an extraordinary opportunity for the University in general and for the Business School in particular,” said Jay O. Light, dean of Harvard Business School (HBS). “One of my goals as the new dean of HBS, after more than 30 years on its faculty, is to increase the amount of collaboration between the Business School and the other professional schools. Thanks to the leadership of President Summers, Allston will become a center for world-class research and development in biotechnology, as well as the home of various Harvard professional schools. These are exciting developments in the history of the University, and I am eager to do all I can to make them a great success.” Gordon said the issue that came to the surface most clearly during the year’s consultation was the look and feel of a future campus. “Harvard faces the challenge of respecting and building on its traditions, while remaining open to design innovation in the new century,” said Gordon. “We know Allston is not going to be a replica of Harvard Yard in Cambridge, however, it has to be equally iconic – a successful common ground for Harvard in the 21st century – and we are working to understand what that means.” In selecting Behnisch Architekten, a design firm known for its leadership in environmentally sustainable design, for Harvard’s science complex in Allston, the University made a conscious decision to emphasize principles of sustainability at the outset of planning for the new campus, beginning with its first project. Stefan Behnisch, as the project’s lead, signals increased expertise in the area of sustainable development and green building design. Ultimately, what happens in Allston will be exceptional and open to all, says Laurie Olin, principal of Olin Partnership and professor of landscape architecture and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania. “One thing about great universities is they have a tradition of providing high-quality public space that is desirable to the university community, the neighborhood, and society at large,” said Olin. “Harvard understands the importance of creating a campus with a generous public realm that is handsome, well built, environmentally sustainable, and attractive and will give the community an identity.” “We can create a place that is open, free, and usable by all people – families and children, and faculty, staff, and students – and contributes to the quality of life of the Allston community and Boston region,” Olin added. In the coming year, The Allston Development Group will assist Harvard’s project planning committees to complete designs for the science complex and the visual arts center, and will begin building both projects. Meanwhile the consultation process will continue through the use of the Allston Room and other forums. Harvard’s planning team expects the preliminary vision for the first full phase of development for Harvard in Allston to become more refined within the next year. That vision includes the further enhancement of Harvard science and research; the strengthening of the University’s professional schools through the increased collaboration and intellectual integration resulting from the relocation of the School of Public Health and Harvard Graduate School of Education; the identification of arts and cultural activities that would enliven a campus; housing for undergraduates along the Charles River; housing for graduate students and community residents; and ways to seamlessly integrate Harvard in Allston, Harvard in Cambridge, the Longwood Medical area, and beyond. “The next steps of the master planning process have to be carefully considered,” said Gordon. “The University has done a lot of thinking about what makes sense, what might fit. We need to refine these ideas and think about how to make the master plan really come alive – what will the new Harvard look like? How can we make it a wonderful, livable place? Where will things be? When will they be built? – these are all key questions to explore further in conversations with people in the coming year.”

Body:
As Commencement closes another chapter of the Harvard story, here is a brief backward glance at some highlights of the year that was. Harvard and the city of Cambridge celebrate the Blackstone renovation (completed in 2006), which converted 46 Blackstone South into Harvard office space near Western Avenue and Memorial Drive. Harvard-donated property across the street (a 1922 utility switch house) was transformed into 33 units of affordable housing. By earning the highest rating of the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program, Blackstone became the first LEED Platinum total-renovation project east of the Mississippi, the first in higher education, and the first in a pre-1900 building. Drew Faust moves into Massachusetts Hall to take up duties as Harvard’s 28th president. Michael D. Smith, the Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, becomes dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The National Weather Service declares Harvard “StormReady,” certifying that the University is prepared to respond quickly and properly to severe weather. Harvard is the first university in New England and the first Ivy League school to earn the three-year renewable certification. A Harvard delegation visits the Vera Foundry in Russia’s Voronezh region, where Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexey II blesses a set of Russian bells newly replicated from the 17 bells that have graced Lowell House since the early 1930s. After years of negotiation, Harvard earlier agreed to return the original bells (ranging from 22 pounds to 13 tons) to Moscow’s Danilov Monastery, their original home. Jeffrey S. Flier, the Caroline Shields Walker Professor of Medicine, becomes dean of the Faculty of Medicine. The Business School launches the 2+2 Program, which grants college students early acceptance to the two-year M.B.A. program at the beginning of their senior year, provided that they graduate and complete two years of approved work experience with any of about 100 participating organizations. The program seeks to expand the School’s applicant pool to students who might not ordinarily consider a business degree or career. Richard Taylor, the Herchel Smith Professor of Mathematics, shares the Shaw Prize in Mathematics with Robert Langlands “of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.” The award recognizes their work in unifying the fields of prime numbers and symmetry. Quincy House gets new co-masters: Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Professor Lee Gehrke and his wife, artist Deborah Gehrke. The couple served as acting co-masters in 2006-07. Bostonians Peter Brooke ’52, M.B.A. ’54 and his wife Anne Brooke announce plans to give their collection of 18 17th century Dutch and Flemish paintings to the University Art Museums. Nine Harvard scientists receive five-year grants totaling $15 million from the National Institutes of Health through the NIH Director’s Pioneer Award and the NIH Director’s New Innovator Award programs. Pioneer Award recipients: Anaesthesia Professor Emery N. Brown, Molecular and Cellular Biology/Neurology Professor Takao Hensch, and Neurology Professor Frances Jensen. New Innovator Award recipients: Immunology and Infectious Diseases Assistant Professor Sarah Fortune; Medicine Instructors Levi Garraway and Konrad Hochedlinger, Medicine Assistant Professor Nir Hacohen, Surgery Assistant Professor Mark Johnson, and Chemistry and Chemical Biology Assistant Professor Alan Saghatelian. Harvard announces an agreement with the state’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to limit greenhouse-gas emissions in the proposed 589,000-square-foot Allston Science Complex to one-half the amount produced by a typical laboratory building already meeting current national standards. The agreement is the first in the nation to legally bind a developer to reducing greenhouse gases beyond existing standards. Sacvan Bercovitch, the Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature Emeritus, wins the Bode-Pearson Prize of the American Studies Association. The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations presents its medal to Dominican Republic President Leonel Antonio Fernández Reyna for his creation of the Foundation for Global Democracy and Development. Former U.S. Representative James A. Leach (R-Iowa) becomes director of the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics. The Provost’s Office approves a five-year budget and business plan to support the Advanced Leadership Initiative being developed by 13 faculty members. ALI will recruit senior leaders in business, law, the military, banking, education, and other professions who have reached the top of their game and are ready for a life of public service. Plans call for a pilot program of some 20 Senior Leadership Fellows by late 2008. Drew Faust gives her first remarks as president at Morning Prayers in Appleton Chapel. The Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences becomes the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the first new Harvard school since 1936, when the Graduate School of Public Administration (now the Kennedy School of Government) was established. Former DEAS Dean Venkatesh Narayanamurti heads the new school. Before a Stadium crowd of 18,898, Harvard plays and wins its first night football game (24-17, against Brown), thanks to lights installed in October 2006. Plans call for one night game per season. Dee Aker, deputy director of the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice (University of San Diego), arrives as the first Phillips Brooks House Fellow. On the corner of Brattle and Story streets, the Harvard Extension School opens a state-of-the-art distance-education facility that allows online students around the world to take part in Cambridge-based classes. Drew Faust is formally installed as Harvard’s 28th president. Tamara Elliott Rogers becomes vice president for alumni affairs and development. Rogers previously served as associate dean for advancement and planning at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. The Boston Redevelopment Authority approves Harvard’s plans for the four-building Allston Science Complex, which will house the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and other emerging interdisciplinary scientific projects at Harvard. The complex will create 1 million square feet of new research space. The J.P. Lemann family makes a major gift to endow the Brazil Studies Program. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute holds a two-day Stem Cell Summit drawing some 500 leading international scientists and nonscientists in the field. Supported by a two-year $400,000 grant from the Henry Luce Foundation, the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs (Kennedy School of Government) launches its interdisciplinary Initiative on Religion in International Affairs, led by Public Policy Associate Professor Monica Duffy Toft and J. Bryan Hehir, the Parker Gilbert Montgomery Professor of the Practice of Religion and Public Life. Philadelphia’s Board of Directors of City Trusts confers the 2007 John Scott Medal upon Joseph P. Vacanti, the John Homans Professor of Surgery and a pioneer in human tissue engineering. Given since 1834, the award salutes those whose inventions have made outstanding contributions to human “comfort, welfare, and happiness.” After a grand renovation and a 30,000-square-foot expansion, the old Hasty Pudding Theatre (12 Holyoke St.) is dedicated as the New College Theatre. The Memorial Church celebrates the publication of the fourth edition of “The Harvard University Hymn Book.” The University announces the creation of a South Asia Initiative designed to enhance Harvard’s scholarly activities related to that part of the world. Chaired by Sugata Bose, the Gardiner Professor of Oceanic History and Affairs, an SAI steering committee will work to expand the number of professors focusing on South Asia, increase the number of scholarships and fellowships for students from the region, facilitate travel to the area for students and faculty, and bring more South Asian speakers to Harvard. For the first time, the University’s recycling rate exceeds 50 percent. In 2002, the monthly record stood at 34 percent. During the annual Veterans Day Commemoration of Benefactors and of the War Dead, the Memorial Church celebrates the 75th anniversary of its dedication. President Drew Faust creates a University-wide task force to examine the role of the arts (curricular and extracurricular) at Harvard, with an eye toward enhancing and supporting greater integration of the arts into University life. Cogan University Professor Stephen Greenblatt chairs the group. The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative sends medicine instructor Susan Bartels and University of Illinois gynecologist Megan App to the Panzi Hospital in the eastern Congo to help doctors ministering to girls and women brutalized during the long-standing onslaught of large-scale sexual and other physical atrocities there. Rhodes Scholarships go to two seniors and a recent graduate: Clara L. Blättler ’08, Sammy K. Sambu ’08, and Shayak Sarkar ’07. Richard Pipes, the Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of History Emeritus, and Ruth R. Wisse, the Martin Peretz Professor of Yiddish Literature, receive the National Humanities Medal at the White House. Harvard School of Public Health Dean Barry R. Bloom announces his intention to step down at the end of June 2008. The Law School’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society receives $4 million from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. It is the largest gift in the center’s history. The Rev. Professor Peter J. Gomes, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, journeys to London’s Southwark Cathedral to help celebrate the 400th anniversary of John Harvard’s birth and baptism. Harvard joins in celebrations for the 200th anniversary of Boston’s Allston-Brighton community. The trust of late media executive Frank Stanton gives $1 million each to the Kennedy School of Government (for an annual lecture on freedom of the press), the Law School (for a postgraduate fellowship on the First Amendment), and the Harvard School of Public Health’s Center for Health Communication. The Game. Harvard wins, 37-6, taking the Ivy League crown in a perfect season. Both teams enter the Yale Bowl with perfect seasons — the first such matchup since the fabled 29-29 contest of 1968. Harvard Management Company President Mohamed A. El-Erian steps down to return to his former company, the Pacific Investment Management Co. The Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership receives a $20 million bequest from Alan L. Gleitsman establishing the Gleitsman Program in Leadership for Social Change. The program will train students to become leaders as social entrepreneurs and social activists. The University and Charlesview Inc. sign a purchase-and-sale agreement that will result in the construction of a new apartment complex for Allston residents on Harvard-owned land. As part of the agreement, Charlesview Inc. will exchange its land at Western Avenue and North Harvard Street for 6.9 acres of Harvard land farther west on Western Avenue. The swapped Charlesview land will become part of Harvard’s future Allston campus. President Drew Faust and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announce a new financial-aid program to make the College more affordable for middle-income families. The new program reduces the expected family contribution from households with incomes below $180,000, replaces student loans (in financial aid packages) with Harvard grants, and eliminates home equity as a factor in determining a family’s ability to pay for college. Mohsen Mostafavi, former dean of the Cornell College of Architecture, Art and Planning, becomes dean of the Graduate School of Design. Donald Pfister, the Asa Gray Professor of Systematic Botany, becomes dean of the Harvard Summer School. Allan M. Brandt, the Amalie Moses Kass Professor of the History of Medicine, becomes dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Harvard adopts a coordinated, University-wide academic calendar that takes effect in 2009-10. One long-sought boon to students: midyear exams in December, before winter recess. College applications soar to an all-time high of 27,462 in Harvard’s first year after ending the Early Action program. (The previous record, set in 2007, was 22,955.) The huge pool also produces the lowest admission rate (7.1 percent) in College history. Hasty Pudding Theatricals picks Charlize Theron as Woman of the Year and Christopher Walken as Man of the Year. The Northeast Asian History Foundation gives a five-year, $1 million grant supporting the Korea Institute’s Early Korea Project. To enhance the distribution of faculty research and scholarship, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences votes to give the University a worldwide license to make each faculty member’s scholarly articles available and to hold the copyright for them, so long as they are not sold for profit. The move seeks in part to overcome the inhibiting effects of (1) scholarly journals that often prevent scholars from using and distributing their own work and (2) journal prices so high that many institutions and individuals cancel their subscriptions. Harvard introduces “H-Link,” an Internet application connecting students’ courses and classmates through the popular Facebook social utility. H-Link allows students to network with Facebook friends in their courses. At the Kennedy School of Government, Mexican President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa reviews the accomplishments of his administration. Indiana University (IU) publishes Sound Directions: Best Practices for Audio Preservation, a major set of protocols developed by Loeb Music Library audio engineer Bruce Gordon and IU audio engineer Mike Casey. The report also includes 40 pieces of software designed at Harvard under the supervision of Loeb audio engineer David Ackerman. The University Library’s Open Collections Program (est. 2002) launches a Web site on “Contagion: Historical Views of Diseases and Epidemics.” The online resource includes more than 500,000 pages of digitized books, pamphlets, serials, incunabula, and manuscripts illuminating the multifaceted role of disease in human history. University of Chicago legal scholar Cass R. Sunstein accepts a professorial appointment at the Law School, where he will direct the new Program on Risk Regulation. The new effort will examine issues such as terrorism, climate change, occupational safety, infectious diseases, and natural disasters. University Bands Director Thomas G. Everett receives the 2008 Luise Vosgerchian Teaching Award for his exceptional contributions to Harvard’s musical life over more than 36 years. The Visual and Environmental Studies Department announces the creation of a doctoral program in film studies, scheduled to begin in fall 2009. President Drew Faust appoints a task force of students, faculty, and administrators charged with recommending strategies for reducing Harvard’s greenhouse gas emissions. Chairing the group is William C. Clark, the Harvey Brooks Professor of International Science Public Policy and Human Development. President Drew Faust and the heads of six other major research universities testify before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to advocate increased funding for the National Institutes of Health. The Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital receives a five-year, $20.5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to expand an international program studying how the AIDS virus (HIV) controls the immune system. The International HIV Controllers Study involves scientists from more than a dozen nations. The Law School announces that it will waive tuition for future third-year students who agree to devote at least five years after law school to jobs in public service. Students must prove their commitment by earning credits for public-service activities in appropriate summer jobs and internships. Oxford University Press publishes the African American National Biography, an eight-volume series containing more than 4,000 life histories compiled by Alphonse Fletcher University Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, the Victor S. Thomas Professor of History and of African and African American Studies. The series is the most comprehensive work of its kind ever published. RMJM, the British-based international architectural firm, gives $1.5 million to the Graduate School of Design to establish the RMJM Program for Research and Education in Integrated Design Practice. The program seeks to produce architects who can balance aesthetic and budgetary concerns through grounding in management principles and technological know-how. Harvard and the city of Boston sign a cooperation agreement outlining more than $25 million in new community programs and neighborhood improvements. The education portal at 175 North Harvard St. is the planned first step, giving Allston-Brighton residents more direct access to community programs at Harvard, math and science tutoring for all school-age Allston children, and public science lectures. Harvard will also create new parks, public open spaces, and walkways, and will support job-training and housing initiatives in the neighborhood. Construction proceeds on the Allston Science Complex. Endowment manager Jane Mendillo is appointed president and CEO of the Harvard Management Company (HMC) starting July 1, 2008. HMC handles the University’s investment portfolio. The World Economic Forum names Harvard Negotiation Project Associate Director Daniel L. Shapiro as one of its Young Global Leaders for 2008. Medical School Dean Jeffrey Flier announces plans for reducing four-year medical-education costs by up to $50,000 for families with incomes of $120,000 or less. About a third of current Harvard medical students will benefit from the change. The Medical School also plans to make major renovations to the 23-year-old Tosteson Medical Education Center. President Drew Faust leads a University delegation to the People’s Republic of China. In Shanghai, she attends the sixth Harvard Alumni Association Global Series, which focuses on East Asia. More than 630 Harvard graduates from 27 nations attend. In Beijing, Faust receives an honorary degree from Peking University. Karen Beck ’08 accepts the 11th Women’s Leadership Award from the Harvard College Women’s Center. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announces plans for a comprehensive 15-year renovation of the 12 undergraduate residential Houses, which were last completely overhauled in the early 1980s when the House system was 50 years old. Strategic and financial plans for the effort are scheduled for submission to President Drew Faust and the Harvard Corporation in December 2008. A gift from Pierre Keller of Geneva establishes a Program on Transatlantic Relations at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. Keller was a CFIA fellow in 1979-80. The Arnold Arboretum unveils the first online installment of its Seed Herbarium Image Project (SHIP), a collection of high-resolution digital photographs documenting the morphology of seeds and fruits. SHIP is a unique reference for everyone interested in plants, from horticulturalists to scientists and educators. In the journal Nature, a team led by Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Gonzalo Giribet publishes results of a comprehensive DNA survey of 77 animal species. The findings settle several long-standing evolutionary controversies and support major changes in certain branches of the evolutionary tree of life. During the five-month Environmental Competition 2008 involving 13 buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, William James Hall and Hoffman Laboratory come out on top for factors such as high recycling rates, reduced energy consumption, and the use of green materials and cleaners. In all, the 13 buildings racked up impressive achievements, such as saving 229 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, which translates to removing 42 cars from the road for a year.
