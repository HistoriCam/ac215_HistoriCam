Notable Facts (Atomic Statements)

Weld Boathouse is primarily associated with women’s rowing rather than men’s heavyweight crews.

Its location at a calm bend of the Charles River supports novice-level sculling instruction.

The building’s architectural firm, Peabody & Stearns, designed many New England landmarks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The boathouse exterior remains largely consistent with its 1906 appearance.

Weld Boathouse is one of the most photographed collegiate boathouses in the United States.

The building historically supported Radcliffe College rowing before Radcliffe integrated into Harvard athletics.

The structure is aligned with Anderson Bridge, sharing compatible architectural details.

Weld Boathouse is important for community rowing, not just varsity athletics.

It was built to replace the smaller 1889 structure which could not meet expanding rowing needs.

The building incorporates both functional marine design and classical Harvard architectural aesthetics.
