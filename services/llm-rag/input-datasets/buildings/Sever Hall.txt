Sever Hall is an academic building at Harvard University designed by the American architect H. H. Richardson and built in the late 1870s. It is located in Harvard Yard in Cambridge, Massachusetts . It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, recognized as one of Richardson's mature masterpieces. Sever Hall was built from 1878 to 1880 with a gift from Anne Sever in honor of her deceased husband, James Warren Sever. It was designed as an academic building with classrooms, lecture halls, rooms for professors, etc., in a style now known as Richardsonian Romanesque though in red brick rather than stone. The building is 176 feet and 4 inches long, by 74 feet and 4 inches wide, with a height to cornice of about 50 feet, above which the hipped roof rises a further 30 feet. It is three stories tall, with a fourth story set within the roof. The main facade (west side) features two round bays set symmetrically about an entrance within a deeply recessed semi-circular archway. The east facade is similar but with a simpler, rectangular entrance. North and south facades are relatively austere expanses punctuated with windows. About 1.3 million bricks were used in its construction. Of these, some 100,000 form the exterior facades, which feature 60 different varieties of red molded brick, as well as elaborate brick carvings. Blood mortar was used as a joiner originally, though polybond compounds have been used in restoration efforts since 1967. The archway admitting entrance into the west facade possesses an acoustical oddity. Whispering directly into the bricks of the archway, while standing very close to one side of the arch, can be heard clearly on the other side of the arch (approximately twelve feet away). In recent years, there has been renewed interest in Sever Hall among architectural historians, [ citation needed ] due to Robert Venturi 's comment that it is his "favorite building in America." He told Boston Globe critic Robert Campbell : "I have come to understand the validity of architecture as generic shelter rather than abstract-expressive sculpture, and as flexible loft for accommodating evolving functions. ... And then I love Sever Hall also for its aesthetic tension deriving from its vital details. I could stand and look at it all day. Thank you, H.H. Richardson." Sever has small classrooms and larger lecture halls, so it is mostly used as a general-purpose classroom building for humanities courses especially small sections, beginning language courses, and Harvard Extension School classes. Grossman Library , a non-circulating library serving Extension School students, was located on the third floor until Extension School library services were integrated into Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences libraries in the late 2010s. The fourth floor of Sever, unnoticed by many of its students as the central stairwell does not lead to it, contains offices for Harvard's Visual and Environmental Studies department. In the evenings and on weekends student groups hold meetings or run annual events. One of Sever's notable annual events is Vericon , run during the break between semesters by the Harvard-Radcliffe Science-Fiction Association , though it has not been hosted since 2016.

Body:
Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer If the angle of light is just right on a sunny December morning, an eerie message appears on the side of Sever Hall. “Kent State 4 dead” is just barely visible in capital letters. At some point the number four was crossed out and replaced with the number seven. Defying the University’s efforts to completely erase it, the remaining, ghostly graffiti recalls a tragic day in American history. Sever, the red brick Romanesque-styled work of Henry Hobson Richardson, also contains a mysterious crypt (an architectural quirk of its designer) and a curious arch at the entrance that looks onto Tercentenary Theatre. Those who stand to one side of the rounded entryway and whisper while facing the building can be heard clearly by those standing on the other end of the wall’s curve. If one looks closely at Widener Library across the way, they might notice its steps are not as steep as those on the adjacent University Hall. The reason, according to John Stilgoe, is that the construction of the massive library coincided with a short-lived fashion trend in women’s clothing in the early 1900s, one in which skirts were cinched tightly around women’s ankles making it impossible for them to raise their feet more than a few inches. Those history lessons were just some of the many offered up by Stilgoe, Harvard’s Robert and Lois Orchard Professor in the History of Landscape Development and a self-described visual historian, during a discussion on March 4. Stilgoe’s talk was part of FreeThink@Harvard, a new interactive e-learning series sponsored by the Dean of Students Office at Harvard Extension School . Each discussion is led by Harvard faculty and includes a classroom chat with a crowd of Harvard alumni, students, faculty, and staff that is also streamed online. Stilgoe began his talk with a brief virtual tour that detailed some of the secrets of Harvard Yard. “The Yard is a rich visual environment and it rewards scrutiny,” the Extension School lecturer states at the beginning of the video. Following the presentation Stilgoe took questions from the classroom crowd and from online viewers as far away as England, the Netherlands, and South Korea. “John’s gift to us, his greatest gift, is to teach us how to pay better attention to the physical world around us,” said Rena Fonseca, assistant dean of students and alumni affairs for Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education , who moderated the event. “As Thoreau wrote, ‘the question is not what you look at, but what you see.’ John teaches us to see.” A member of the classroom crowd, Associate Dean for the Master of Liberal Arts program at the Harvard Extension School Sue Schopf, wanted to know where students could gain “the necessary eye and tools to be able to make these kinds of observations?” Stilgoe urged Schopf and those listening both in the room and online to simply go outside. “I think they ought to go out to recess more. I think we’re all too busy looking at screens and I think that we are not just spending time looking around,” said Stilgoe, adding, “I think it’s something that has to be encouraged before children go to kindergarten, and I think mostly it means going for a walk.” Watch the entire FreeThink event . The next FreeThink@Harvard talk, “Growth Companies: Succeeding Beyond the Start-up Phase,” is scheduled for April 29.

Body:
Sever Hall, a National Historic Landmark widely regarded as an architectural gem, has emerged radiant and refreshed from its three-month restoration and remodeling. The façade of the 1880 building, designed by master architect Henry Hobson Richardson, was painstakingly preserved with upgrades to bricks, mortar, brownstone, terra-cotta roof tiles, and windows. Inside the building, the fourth and fifth floors have been opened up to create new space for the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, including the film program. The new space, designed by Kennedy & Violich Architecture, includes a dramatic two-story atrium, three screening rooms, a computer lab, an animation studio, a new video and film book library, video viewing stations, the Film Studies Center, a seminar room, and faculty and staff offices. At right, Ruth Lingford, visiting lecturer on visual and environmental studies, leads an animation class in Sever’s newly renovated fourth floor. – Steve BradtInside Sever Hall, the fourth and fifth (above) floors have been opened up to create new space for the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, including the film program.
