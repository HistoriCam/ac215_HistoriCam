[WIKIPEDIA]
Memorial Hall , immediately north of Harvard Yard on the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts , is a High Victorian Gothic building honoring Harvard University alumni's sacrifices in defending the Union during the American Civil War ‍—‌"a symbol of Boston 's commitment to the Unionist cause and the abolitionist movement in America". Built on a former playing field known as the Delta, the structure was intended to be imposing. It was described by Henry James as having three main divisions: one of them a theater, for academic ceremonies; another a vast refectory , covered with a timbered roof, hung about with portraits and lighted by stained windows, like the halls of the colleges of Oxford; and the third, the most interesting, a chamber high, dim and severe, consecrated to the sons of the university who fell in the long Civil War. James's "three divisions" are Sanders Theatre, Annenberg Hall (formerly Alumni Hall or the Great Hall), and Memorial Transept. Beneath Annenberg Hall, Loker Commons offers a number of student facilities. Memorial Hall is, in the opinion of the President and Fellows , the most valuable gift the Uni­ver­si­ty has ever received, with respect alike to cost, daily usefulness, and moral significance. This happy commemorative creation of the Union ... the great bristling brick Valhalla of the early "seventies," that house of honor and of hos­pi­tal­ity which [dispenses] laurels to the dead and dinners to the living. A huge Victorian Gothic barn. Between 1865 and 1868, an alumni "Committee of Fifty" raised $370,000 (equal to one-twelfth of Harvard's entire endowment at the time) toward a new building in memory of Harvard men who had fought for the Union in the American Civil War , particularly the 136 dead ‍—‌a "Hall of Alumni in which students and graduates might be inspired by the pictured and sculpted presence of her founders, benefactors, faculty, presidents, and most distinguished sons". When, about the same time, a $40,000 bequest was received from Charles Sanders (class of 1802) for "a hall or theatre to be used on [any] public occasion connected with the College, whether literary or festive", a vision was formed of a single building containing a large theater as well as a large open hall, and thus meeting both goals. A site was found on the "Delta", the triangle bounded by Cambridge, Kirkland, and Quincy Streets. [ A ] The project was formally named Memorial Hall in September 1870, and on October 6 the cornerstone was laid, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. composing a hymn for the occasion. [ B ] In May 1878, the Committee of Fifty notified the President and Fellows that the project was complete and the premises ready for formal transfer to the university. On July 8 the President and Fellows unanimously voted to "accept with profound gratitude this splendid and precious gift". The building's High Victorian Gothic design, by Harvard alumni William Robert Ware and Henry Van Brunt , was selected in a blind competition. A 1907 publication gives dimensions of 305 by 113 feet, with a height of 190 feet at the tower; a 2012 source gave a height of 195 feet, making it the ninth-tallest building in Cambridge at that time. Its 1970 National Historic Landmark designation recognized it one of the nation's most dramatic examples of High Victorian Gothic architecture. A general restoration was carried out between 1987 and 1996. What was originally known as Alumni Hall [ citation needed ] —nine thousand square feet shaped by massive wooden trusses, walnut paneling, and a blue, stenciled ceiling—was dedicated in 1874. Originally intended for formal occasions such as alumni dinners, it was almost immediately converted to a dining commons, and was for fifty years the college's main dining hall (charging, in 1884, $3.97 for a month's meals). In 1893, Harvard Graduates Magazine described "the throngs of men who, at one o'clock, are to be seen racing across the yard from Harvard , Boylston , and Sever [Halls], striving to reach [Memorial] Hall ahead of slower competitors for vacant seats at the overtaxed tables". But "as the center of University life moved south toward the Charles , [the dining commons] became less popular and closed in 1925" ( see Harvard College § House system ), after which Alumni Hall saw mostly light use, typically as a venue for dances, banquets, examinations, and the like. In 1934, The New York Times reported that Harvard officials had "at last found a use for Memorial Hall" by siting a rifle range in the basement. During World War II , the Crimson reported that "the Great Hall" was being used "in winter-time for the 6 o'clock in the morning calisthenics of the [military] Chaplain's School" (though without explaining why Harvard Divinity students had been singled out for this treatment) and intimated that Stevens Laboratory, in the basement, "is doing secret work in acoustics". After extensive renovations, in 1996 the space was renamed Annenberg Hall and supplanted, as the freshmen dining hall, the Harvard Union , which had performed that function during most of the intervening time. Sanders Theatre, substantially completed in 1875 and first used for Harvard's 1876 commencement, was inspired by Christopher Wren's Sheldonian Theatre . Renowned for its acoustics, and with 1000 seats one of Harvard's largest classrooms, [ clarification needed ] Sanders is in great demand for lectures, concerts, ceremonies and conferences. Winston Churchill , Theodore Roosevelt , Martin Luther King Jr. , and Mikhail Gorbachev have spoken there. Sanders features John La Farge 's stained-glass window Athena Tying a Mourning Fillet ; statues of James Otis (by Thomas Crawford ) and Josiah Quincy III (by William Wetmore Story ) flank the stage. The exterior gables display busts of great orators: Demosthenes , Cicero , John Chrysostom , Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet , William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham , Edmund Burke , and Daniel Webster . Sanders Theatre contributed in an unusual way to the early work of Wallace Sabine , considered the founder of architectural acoustics. In 1895, tasked with improving the dismal acoustical performance of the Fogg Museum's lecture hall, Sabine carried out a series of nocturnal experiments there, using hundreds of seat cushions borrowed from nearby Sanders as sound-absorbent material; his work each night was limited by the requirement that the cushions be returned to Sanders in time for morning lectures there. The scientific unit of sound absorption, the sabin , is very close to the absorption provided by one Sanders Theatre cushion. The Memorial Transept [2,600 square feet (240 m 2 )] serves as a vestibule for Sanders Theatre. It consists of a 60-foot-high (18 m) gothic vault above a marble floor, with black walnut paneling and stenciled walls, a large stained glass window over each of two exterior doors, and twenty-eight white tablets listing the 136 Harvard men who died fighting for the Union: Down the lofty and impressive main corridor there are tablets to one after another of the many who thus died‍—‌a thrilling list. One sees such old New England names as Peabody , Wadsworth , and Bowditch ; one sees the name of Fletcher Webster ; one sees that an Edward Revere died at Antietam and a Paul Revere at Gettysburg . Confederate deaths are not represented. Beneath Annenberg Hall, Loker Commons offers a student pub, music practice spaces, and other facilities. Twenty-two stained-glass windows, installed between 1879 and 1902, include several by John La Farge , Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios, Donald MacDonald , Sarah Wyman Whitman , and Charles Mills . The central tower was nearly complete by 1876, but criticism convinced Van Brunt and Ware to revise it in 1877. In 1897, added was what a 1905 guidebook described as "an enormous [four-faced clock which] detonates the hours in a manner which is by no means conducive to the sleep of the just and the rest of the weary", and which Kenneth John Conant termed "railroad Gothic". In 1932, the clock's driving works, and the associated 155-pound (70 kg) bell-clapper, were somehow lowered 115 feet (35 m) to the ground without attracting attention; visiting Yale students were suspected but the clapper was never found. Three years later the disappearance of the replacement clapper, under similar circumstances, was rumored to be Yale University 's revenge for the theft of its mascot, Handsome Dan . The upper half of the tower was destroyed by fire in 1956 and rebuilt, to its 1877–1897 appearance, in 1996. In the 1960s Kirkland Street was truncated in conjunction with construction of the Science Center , so that the Delta no longer exists as an isolated city block. [ citation needed ] Not with the anguish of hearts that are breaking / Come we as mourners to weep for our dead; Grief in our breasts has grown weary with aching, / Green is the turf where our tears we have shed. While o'er their marbles the mosses are creeping / Stealing each name and its record away. Give their proud story to memory's keeping, / Shrined in the temple we hallow today. Hushed are their battlefields, ended their marches. / Deaf are their ears to the drumbeat of morn-- Rise from the sod ye far columns and arches! / Tell their bright deeds to the ages unborn. Emblem and legend may fade from the portal, / Keystone may crumble and portal may fall; They were the builders whose work is immortal, / Crowned with the dome that is over us all.

Corydon Ireland Harvard Staff Writer In 1866, Union Army veteran Thomas Wentworth Higginson called the Civil War “that magic epoch of adventure which has just passed by,” an experience so novel that its youthful warriors “were striking out for some new planet. The past was annihilated, the future was all.” But not all of the past was annihilated. Harvard alumni started discussions about a memorial in May 1865, as the war ended. By December they had chosen a design. Memorial Hall was to be an ornate Gothic Revival structure, with 5,000 square feet of stained glass, a 210-foot tower, intricate slate roofing, and gargoyles sheathed with copper. One critic later called it an “impossible conglomerate of mutations.” Novelist Henry James was kinder, writing in 1888 that the hall — “a great, bristling, brick Valhalla” — dispensed “laurels to the dead and dinners to the living.” By the summer of 1874, Memorial Hall’s transept was finished, a compact indoor space where 28 tablets memorialized 136 of Harvard’s Union dead. The finished building, Sanders Theatre included, was dedicated on June 24, 1878. One of the speakers was Civil War hero William Francis Bartlett ’62. Thirteen years before, at a Harvard ceremony for returning veterans, he could hardly speak. But in the new hall, Bartlett found his voice. “Their fame is secure, immutable, immortal,” he said of the honored slain. “We shall grow old and wear out, but they shall always keep for us their glorious, spotless youth.” Bartlett, his health shattered by the war, died six months later.

Title: Recalling patriotic words on Memorial Hall birthday

Helen Hannon Special to the Harvard News Office “…united we are forever invincible….” – William Francis Bartlett June 23 is the 130th anniversary of the dedication of Memorial Hall Transept and Alumni Hall, now known as Annenberg Hall. Memorial Hall was built to honor the Harvard men who died fighting for the Union in the Civil War. The feelings that Civil War memorials evoked in the 19th century can be compared with those evoked by monuments of our time – such as the Vietnam War Memorial. Harvard’s memorial was to be a unique building that would include a theater and large dining hall. The dedication was the culmination of years of effort, particularly by an alumni group called the “Committee of Fifty.” In fact, it was Harvard’s first major fundraising drive. But it was the following day, June 24, 1874, at the first commencement dinner held in Memorial Hall, that Brevet Major General William Francis Bartlett gave a speech that resounded throughout the nation. Bartlett, Class of 1862, was a junior at Harvard College when the Civil War started. His first military service began on April 17, 186l, with the 4th Battalion Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. On July 10, 1861, he accepted a commission as captain of the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, known as “The Harvard Regiment” because so many of its officers were Harvard students. Bartlett’s first serious action was at the battle of Ball’s Bluff, Va. – a particularly devastating day for the men of the 20th Massachusetts. Bartlett’s first injury was at the siege of Yorktown on April 24, 1862. He was hit by a sharpshooter and his leg was amputated four inches above the knee. However, he continued to serve. At the battle of Port Hudson, La., on May 27, 1863, Bartlett knew he couldn’t lead the regiment with his wooden leg so he rode a horse into battle. After the battle, Confederate officers asked about the man on horseback. They said, “He was a gallant fellow … We thought him too brave a man to be killed, and ordered our men not to fire at him.” Nevertheless, Bartlett was in the line of fire and was severely wounded in his arm and other foot. After recuperating from this injury, he returned to service as colonel of the 57th Massachusetts Volunteers. On July 30, 1864, Bartlett was taken prisoner during the assault on “the Crater” at Petersburg, Va. He suffered a serious illness during his two months in prison. The ordeal was made worse by reports that he would soon be exchanged for a Confederate prisoner – only to have the process repeatedly delayed. The prisoner exchange finally took place in September 1864. On March 13, 1865, at the age of 24, Bartlett was promoted to Brevet Major General, U.S. Volunteers. But his health was ruined. He sailed to Europe in October 1865 with his new bride, Mary Agnes Pomeroy of Pittsfield, Mass., to recuperate. He resigned his commission after returning home in July 1866. He then went into paper and iron manufacturing. In his autobiography, “Memories of a Happy Life,” William Lawrence, Episcopal bishop of Massachusetts, described the scene at that first Commencement dinner in Memorial Hall. “The ‘bloody shirt’ still waved, and sectional spirit was hot and bitter … the alumni of Harvard, soldiers, sailors, and civilians, dined for the first time in the great Hall dedicated to the dead of the Civil War. The afternoon was hot; many speeches had been made, when General Frank Bartlett, the Chief Marshal of the day was called upon. Gaunt, emaciated, full of spirit, hardly touching his crutches, he stood erect and strong on one leg, and threw into his sentences an even greater courage than he had shown in battle, challenging the Harvard men of the North.” Bartlett biographer Francis Palfry was also at the Commencement dinner and described the day. “Cambridge commencement dinners are crowded affairs, as a rule, but this day the interest excited by the new building drew together an unusual throng…. A midsummer’s day at Cambridge is apt to be hot and this day was not an exception…. It is not a favorable moment for the debut of an orator. And yet when Bartlett arose, and the first words uttered by his deep and manly voice were heard, and the audience became aware that they came from the shattered soldier whose tall and slender form and wasted face they had seen at the head of the procession as he painfully marshaled it that day, a great silence fell upon the multitude, and he continued and finished his speech in the midst of silence, except when it was broken, as it was more than once, by spontaneous bursts of cheering.” Bartlett told the audience, “I firmly believe that when the gallant men of Lee’s army surrendered at Appomattox … they followed the example of their heroic chief, and, with their arms, laid down forever their disloyalty to the Union. Take care, then, lest you repel, by injustice, or suspicion, or even by indifference, the returning love of men who now speak with pride of that flag as ‘our flag.’” Bishop Lawrence enthusiastically records that the “speech sounded through New England and the whole county: and the people responded … [and] caught a new vision of patriotism.” It is a credit to Harvard’s history that the first steps to truly unite the country after the Civil War began in Memorial Hall. It is particularly appropriate that a building dedicated to honor those who died to preserve the Union should be the starting point of this reconciliation.

Title: Vertical Harvard

Corydon Ireland Harvard Staff Writer Over its first 200 years, Harvard soared academically, but its architecture stayed low. In keeping with the modesty of Puritan traditions, Harvard Yard remained a huddle of low-roofed structures until the 19th century. Historians speculate that Peyntree House, the College’s first home in 1638, was just 2½ stories high. Inside there was just one set of stairs. Outside was a steep roof more suited to thatch than to shingle. The building’s sole eminence, a central chimney, was utilitarian. And for centuries Harvard stayed horizontal. The first Harvard Hall (1682) was three wooden stories topped by a squat cupola and a weathervane. Massachusetts Hall (1720) was four stories of stout brick. The second Harvard Hall (1766) was a bookend of the same height. Hollis Hall (1761) was Puritan plain, an “honest old frame,” said one 19th-century commentator. Stoughton Hall (1804) too was a blunt brick box. Then up, up went Gore Hall in 1838: a Gothic wedding cake of sky-poking spires modeled after a 15th-century chapel at Cambridge University. In 1856, Appleton Chapel shot into the air too, with a steeple as pointed as a dagger. Then Puritan modesty reasserted itself. Boylston Hall (1857) was built short and square, two stories of granite later capped with a mansard roof. Grays Hall (1863) was taller, but modest, with rounded rooflines that seemed to defy verticality. It had a bunkered appearance, befitting a building that went up quietly during the Civil War. But during the joy and hubris of the post-war years in America, architectural Harvard took another vacation from modesty. Matthews Hall opened in 1873: five stories layered with Gothic ornamentation and topped with a roofline of gabled windows. Then came the most immodest building of all, the one that definitively began modern vertical Harvard. Memorial Hall (1875-1878) was an extravaganza of high-Victorian Gothic style. It had a 210-foot tower, 5,000 square feet of stained glass, intricate slate roofing, and copper-sheathed gargoyles. Novelist Henry James called it “a great, bristling, brick Valhalla.” Harvard never went horizontal again. After 1878, the University awoke to its verticality, gaining a sense of itself as important to the nation and to the world. By the 1930s, the new river Houses added towers to Harvard’s now iconic waterfront skyline. Their towers were outward signs of both the University’s transformed aesthetics and its accelerating aspirations. “Towers are largely about beauty,” Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin, a 2013 Nieman Fellow, wrote in an email. “They’re also about advertisement, whether for a corporation or a college or a country.” Harvard’s era of building towers, he added, was about “projecting an identity.” By 1932, Appleton Chapel had been razed to make room for Memorial Church, whose gleaming spire still points to the heavens. For both secular and sacred architecture, wrote Kamin, “Towers lift us above the profane (the ground) and toward the sacred (the sky). It’s hard to imagine Harvard without its towers.”
