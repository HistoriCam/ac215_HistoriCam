Harvard Business School ( HBS ) is the graduate business school of Harvard University , a private Ivy League research university . Located in Allston, Massachusetts , HBS owns Harvard Business Publishing , which publishes business books, leadership articles, case studies , and Harvard Business Review , a monthly academic business magazine. It is also home to the Baker Library/Bloomberg Center , the school's primary library. Harvard Business School is one of six Ivy League business schools . The school was established in 1908. Initially established by the humanities faculty, it received independent status in 1910, and became a separate administrative unit in 1913. The first dean was historian Edwin Francis Gay (1867–1946). Yogev (2001) explains the original concept: The business school pioneered the development of the case method of teaching, drawing inspiration from this approach to legal education at Harvard. Cases are typically descriptions of real events in organizations. They are written by school faculty members who earn royalties on their sales. Students are positioned as managers and are presented with problems which they need to analyze and provide recommendations on. From the start the school enjoyed a close relationship with the corporate world. Within a few years of its founding many business leaders were its alumni and were hiring other alumni for starting positions in their firms. At its founding, the school accepted only male students. The Training Course in Personnel Administration , founded at Radcliffe College in 1937, was the beginning of business training for women at Harvard. HBS took over administration of that program from Radcliffe in 1954. In 1959, alumnae of the one-year program (by then known as the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration) were permitted to apply to join the HBS MBA program as second-years. In December 1962, the faculty voted to allow women to enter the MBA program directly. The first women to apply directly to the MBA program matriculated in September 1963. Harvard Business School played a role in the founding of the first business schools in the United Kingdom, delivering six-week Advanced Management Program courses alongside local staff at Durham in 1964, Bangor in 1965 and at Strathclyde in 1966. It also brought in professors from the newly founded British business schools to see how teaching was carried out at Harvard via an International Teachers Program. In 2012–2013, HBS administration implemented new programs and practices to improve the experience of female students and recruit more female professors. HBS established nine global research centers and four regional offices and functions through offices in Asia Pacific (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore), United States (San Francisco Bay Area, CA), Europe (Paris, opened in 2003), South Asia (India), Middle East and North Africa (Dubai, Istanbul, Tel Aviv), Japan and Latin America (Montevideo, Mexico City, São Paulo). As of 2022, HBS was ranked fifth in the nation by U.S. News & World Report , third in the world by the Financial Times , and second in the world by QS World University Rankings . Most full-time students study for an MBA, although doctoral programs are also undertaken. Executive education is provided, and online courses. Baker Scholars are those MBA students with academic honors over the two year course in the top 5% of their year class. HBS students can join more than 95 different clubs and student organizations on campus. The Student Association (SA) is the main interface between the MBA student body and the faculty/administration. In addition, the HBS student body is represented at the university level by the Harvard Graduate Council . In 2015, executive education contributed $168 million to HBS's total revenue of $707 million. This included: The school's faculty are divided into 10 academic units: Accounting and Management; Business, Government and the International Economy; Entrepreneurial Management; Finance; General Management; Marketing; Negotiation, Organizations and Markets; Organizational Behavior; Strategy; and Technology and Operations Management. Older buildings include the 1927-built Morgan Hall, named for J.P. Morgan , and 1940-built Loeb house, named for John L. Loeb Sr. and his son, (both designed by McKim, Mead & White ), and the 1971-built Burden Hall with a 900-seat auditorium. In the fall of 2010, Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center. The executive center was named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP, 1975), the chairman of Tata Sons . The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million. Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus. The facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's Executive Education programs. At seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet, it contains about 180 bedrooms for education students, in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces. Kresge Way was located by the base of the former Kresge Hall, and is named for Sebastian S. Kresge . In 2014, Kresge Hall was replaced by a new hall that was funded by a US$30 million donation by the family of the late Ruth Mulan Chu Chao , whose four daughters all attended Harvard Business School. The Executive Education quad currently includes McArthur, Baker, and Mellon Halls (residences), McCollum and Hawes (classrooms), Chao Center, and Glass (administration). Most of the HBS buildings are connected by a color-coded basement tunnel system which is open to pedestrian traffic. Tunnels open to maintenance workers only carry steam pipes to the rest of the campus, and connect Kresge with the Blackstone steam plant in Cambridge, via the Weeks Footbridge.

Title: Secretary of Treasury Paulson talks about China’s booming economy
Date: May 10, 2007

Ruth Walker Special to Harvard News Office “Time is of the essence,” Henry Paulson told the capacity crowd at Burden Hall on the Harvard Business School (HBS) campus Thursday afternoon (May 3). China needs to make some critical economic reforms — floating its currency, reforming its capital markets, and restructuring so that domestic consumption plays a bigger role — and the time to make them is now, when China is booming and the global economy is strong. “All of us recognize,” Paulson said, “that over the past three or four or five years we’ve seen a global economy as strong as anything I’ve seen in my business career … and as you look at the past five years, the U.S. and China have accounted for about half of that global growth.” The secretary of the U.S. Treasury was on campus to speak to students of Harvard Business School, the Kennedy School of Government, and Harvard Law School on the U.S.-China relationship. “One of the lessons I’ve learned over the years is it’s always easier to make changes, reforms, when things are going well,” he explained, adding that the kind of opening for China to trade in goods and services that’s needed would go “far beyond the requirements of WTO [the World Trade Organization]; WTO is just a minimal point.” Paulson was in Shanghai on March 8, just days after the dramatic drop in the stock exchange there that touched off a round of market volatility in capital markets around the globe. While acknowledging the progress the Chinese have made, he was blunt in insisting that their capital markets are not reflective of their economy as a whole: “They need to do more work on their capital markets,” he told the Burden Hall crowd. Specifically, he mentioned that the $2 trillion in individual savings accounts in China is earning an annual return of some 2.5 percent — “not a positive return when you allow for inflation and taxes.” But China, he noted, is growing at 10 percent a year, and the Chinese savings rate is about 50 percent. Clearly, he suggested, something is out of whack. The currency, Paulson explained, “is a symbol for the pace of reform.” There are plenty of countries whose currency is controlled by the government rather than the market, he said, but none of them so big, or so well integrated into the global economy as China. He called the exchange rates “unsustainable in the long term.” But if he had a number of policy prescriptions for China, he also acknowledged, “China is a sovereign nation so they are going to do things that make sense for them.” With China on pace to overtake the United States as the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the question of energy and the environment is necessarily an aspect of the U.S.-China relationship. Paulson sounded bullish on technological solutions to the problem of climate change. Since he came to Washington last year after a long career at Goldman Sachs, Paulson said, “I haven’t found that many of the problems, as I’ve looked at them close-up, look easier. But the area where I’ve received the most good news is spending time at the Department of Energy and with others, and learning about some of the technologies we’ve got coming.” He cited cellulosic ethanol as an example. Both China and the United States need alternative sources of energy, Paulson said. “We’re talking a lot about sharing technology.” Paulson ticked off several items on the running agenda he maintains with Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi, his opposite number in the two countries’ Strategic Economic Dialogue, the next session of which is to be held in Washington later this month: In response to a question about the Dubai ports debacle of last year (which occurred before he took office, he noted) and the problem of balancing national security and economic openness, he said, “National security trumps everything,” but added, “It shouldn’t be difficult to balance the two. We’ve done it for many years.” Paulson, an ebullient optimist who couldn’t resist prefacing his talk in Burden Hall with some career advice, told his audience, “It’s going to be a terrific time to go out and get jobs,” because the problems keep getting “more and more interesting.” He urged even those students not working for global companies keep a “global mind-set.” He continued, “So many people want to be career engineers … avoid short-term-ism. The important thing is to learn and to grow.” Asked about the challenges of balancing the long and the short term, he said, “In every walk of life, that’s the most important question. “The really outstanding CEOs are the ones that manage for long-term success. But if you don’t pay attention to the short term, you won’t make it to the long term. You’ve got to make it through the night.”

Title: China premier comes to Harvard
Date: December 11, 2003

Body:
Beth Potier Harvard News Office Capping his first-ever visit to the United States with a talk at Harvard University yesterday (Dec. 10), Wen Jiabao, premier of the People’s Republic of China, drew upon China’s rich cultural past and current atmosphere of openness to predict a bright future of development, economic wealth, and democracy. To understand China, he told the audience of Harvard students, faculty, staff, and invited dignitaries, “it is necessary to get to know her yesterday, her today, and her tomorrow.” Wen’s speech, in Burden Hall on the Harvard Business School campus, was simultaneously translated from Mandarin into English. Illustrating his theme of cross-cultural understanding and respect, Wen quoted Western philosophers and poets, including Voltaire, Kant, Emerson, and U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt. “Reading the words of Voltaire and Emerson today, I cannot but admire their vision and foresight,” he said. The principles of populism and democracy run through Chinese culture as far back as Confucius, he added. “China today is a country in reform and opening up and a rising power dedicated to peace,” he said. Wen pitched his remarks toward the many students in the audience, who received tickets to the event via lottery. In his opening remarks, Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers said that Harvard has 350 Chinese students; it seemed that many of them, identifiable by laughter that preceded the English translation of some of Wen’s remarks, attended the event and waved the flag of their homeland in support. “I hope the young people of China and the young people of the United States will join their hands more closely,” Wen said. “I hope the young people in this country will turn their eyes to China.” As premier, the third highest-ranking official in the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China hierarchy, Wen – an engineer by training – oversees the country’s economic reforms. He outlined a strategy for modernization that would raise China’s level of development significantly by its centenary in 2049. He stressed that the nation’s large population of 1.3 billion and its yet-underdeveloped status continue to define it. “Any small individual problem multiplied by 1.3 billion becomes a big, big problem,” he said. “This is a reality that China’s leaders have to keep firmly in mind at all times.” Describing “extensive and profound changes never seen in China before,” Wen said that the nation is working to become a socialist market economy and, with the lifting of restrictions on its citizens’ mobility, faith, travel, lifestyles, and enterprise, is embracing democratic ideals. “Each and every step forward is designed, in the final analysis, to release the gushing vitality of labor, knowledge, technology, managerial expertise, and capital, and allow all sources of social wealth to flow to the fullest extent,” he said. Wen repeatedly credited China’s economic growth to its policies of reform and opening up, noting that many Chinese now enjoy a comfortable standard of living and some regions of China, particularly the cities on its southeast coast, have surged toward modernity with skyscrapers, traffic, and glittering lights. Still, the rural areas of central and western China remain backwards, and the premier said he’s torn with anxiety when he ponders the poverty in which millions of farmers and urban poor continue to live. “For China to reach the level of developed countries, it will still take the sustained hard work of several generations, a dozen generations, or even dozens of generations,” he said. Wen was upbeat, however, about the wealth of China’s large labor pool, which must be protected to avoid a fate akin to some of the less fortunate characters of Charles Dickens, and its brand of socialism, which he called “brimming with vigor and vitality.” While he largely avoided some of the hot-button issues that have dominated his four-day visit to the U.S. – Taiwan and China’s trade imbalance with the U.S. – Wen addressed his nation’s controversial human rights record head-on. “China’s reform and opening up is aimed at promoting human rights in China. The two are mutually dependent,” he said, conceding, “I’m not suggesting that China’s human rights situation is impeccable.” Prior to those remarks, a lone protester was escorted from the hall for interrupting Wen’s speech with a statement against China’s occupation of Tibet. Two additional protestors, who stood in silence, remained in the hall throughout the speech. Yet Wen, who has a reputation as a self-effacing man of the people, had already gained the support of the audience with warm and personal anecdotes that illustrated his humble upbringing and conveyed his genuine affection for students and youth. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences William C. Kirby, a scholar of Chinese history, fielded three questions (one submitted in advance and two from audience members) for Wen. After expanding on China’s development of democracy in response to the first question, the premier addressed the audience directly. “People sometimes have mixed feelings about giving a speech at Harvard,” he said, noting the obvious appeal of its shining intellectual resources. “But they know from the faculty and students there will be tough questions.” And indeed, David Wilson ’06 pressed the premier to outline the steps China will take to encourage American trade into China. Wen discussed several proposals he made Tuesday to President Bush on the subject and noted that trade delegations from China had made major purchases from U.S. firms Boeing and General Electric. “We should not turn trade issues into political ones,” he cautioned. As the audience of nearly 800 filed out of Burden Hall, the buzz on Premier Wen’s speech was generally positive. “He seems quite amiable as a premier,” said Li Li, a doctoral student at Harvard Business School and a native of China. She had followed his U.S. tour and felt his Harvard speech reinforced the position he had been stating for the past few days. “As a business school student, I would rather he spoke more about the reforms going on in China, which are quite challenging,” she added. “But in general, it was a very satisfying address.” Premier Wen’s visit to Harvard was hosted by the Office of the President; the Harvard University Asia Center, which supported the visit through the Dora and YL Yang Fund; and the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research. It came at the end of a four-day trip to the U.S. Wen visited New York Monday, where he met with Mayor Michael Bloomberg and business executives; and he met with President George W. Bush at the White House Tuesday to discuss Taiwan, terrorism, and trade relations.
