The Beck-Warren House , also known as the Warren House , is a historic house located in Cambridge, Massachusetts . Now on the campus of Harvard University , this large Greek Revival wood-frame house was built in 1833 for Professor Charles Beck , and was later purchased and adapted by the physically disabled Henry Clarke Warren , a Sanskrit scholar. Since 1899 it has belonged to Harvard University , for whom it presently houses offices. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The Warren House stands in the eastern part of the Harvard campus, on the west side of Prescott Street, as part of an entire city block (just east of Harvard Yard ) of Harvard-owned buildings. It has a 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 -story main block, which is covered by a front-facing gable roof, with single-story side-gabled wings extending to the sides that are flush with the front facade. The main facade faces west, into a pedestrian area providing access to the other Harvard buildings on the block. The main block's corners are pilastered, while those of the wings have wooden quoining. The gable is fully pedimented, with a half-round window at the center. A single-story porch extends across the central three bays, its flat roof and entablature supported by smooth Doric columns. The interior features a distinctive blend of Greek Revival and Colonial Revival features, the latter done during the ownership of Henry Warren, handicapped by a spinal deformity from childhood. The second-floor alterations were particularly made to adapt to his needs. The house was built in 1833 by Charles Beck , a Professor of Latin at Harvard. It was built on land that was previously part of the large estate of Francis Dana and subdivided by his heirs. It was acquired in 1891 by Henry Clarke Warren, serving as his home until his death in 1899. Warren made numerous alterations to the interior to accommodate his physical disability, including an overly sized heating system which he was said to run up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. When Henry Clarke Warren died in 1899 he bequeathed the house to Harvard. When first acquired, it was used to house the philosophy library, and then the English department. It was moved in 1900 (within its historic lot) to make room for the construction of the Harvard Union to the south. Since 1997, it has served as offices for other Harvard organizations.

Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer The latest bathroom technology is everywhere on Harvard’s campus: low-flush urinals, dual-flush toilets, metered faucets, and hands-free paper towel dispensers. But sometime, take a step into the past and enter Beck-Warren House, where the second-floor bathroom is so preserved it could be a museum. In 1891, the home’s second owner, Henry Clarke Warren, who was handicapped after injuring his spine as a child, outfitted his bathroom with special features such as a call bell and a two-tiered, zinc bathtub. The reclusive Warren lived on the second floor, where he installed other call bells, skylights, a heated sunporch, and a specially designed bed. He heated his rooms to 90 degrees as a respite from his chronic pain. Despite his lifelong suffering, Warren attained distinction in his field with his pioneering research in Sanskrit and Pali texts. He worked standing — with the aid of crutches — but eventually this became impossible so he worked kneeling on a chair, supporting his weight by leaning on his elbows. Warren’s great friend Charles Lanman, a Sanskrit professor at Harvard, once joked with Warren about the latter’s “trouser knees,” which were frayed from his constant kneeling. Warren answered, “Ah, but when St. Peter sees those knees, he’ll say, ‘Pass right in, sir, pass right in.’” By the 1980s, the extraordinary bathroom was featured in a mystery novel, one of a series by Amanda Cross. She wrote: “Janet was found in an inebriated state in an ancient bathroom in some old frame house where the English Department hangs out …” Just outside the bathroom is another curious feature of the house: a trap door in the hallway floor believed to have been used to hide runaway slaves by the home’s original owner, Harvard Latin Professor Charles Beck. The door was discovered in the 1940s when workers found old draperies, musty carpets, a bed, and a dresser with a photograph of a cow on it. The secret passageway was later sealed off when students were found playing in there. Upon his death in 1899, Warren left most of his estate, including this house, with its interesting past, to Harvard, which had “provided him a sanctuary unlike any he had been able to achieve within his family.” A year later the house was moved slightly to accommodate construction of the Harvard Union (now called Barker) and currently serves as office space for the faculty and staff of Celtic languages and literatures, folklore and mythology, and the Mahindra Humanities Center.

- This unusual plumbing under the bathroom sink resembles a musical G clef.
- “Down the hall was the ancient dignified bathroom,” wrote Carolyn Gold Heilbrun whose nom de plume was Amanda Cross. In her 1981 mystery novel, “Death in a Tenured Position,” this room figures prominently.
- Worn and random brown tesserae are patterned on the floor of the 1891 bathroom.
- The marble basin and faucets are presumed original.
- Toilets can be beautiful — check out this verdigris patina.
- The pull chain adds some fittingly regal flair to this toilet, which is sometimes slangily referred to as “the throne.”
- The toilet base is composed of porcelain and ornamented with a relief pattern depicting a basket of rushes that was originally embellished with gold leaf.
- This call bell was once used by the disabled homeowner, Henry Clarke Warren. It’s one of several bells on the second floor.
- Glazed white ceramic tiles on walls and ceilings surround the two-tiered zinc bathtub.
- While the curtain tabs remain, the elaborate showerhead is no longer used.
- Warren’s specially built zinc tub fills one side of the room and contains a seat at one end that was presumably helpful during his lifetime of incessant pain.
- The floor’s mosaic is reflected in the tub’s shiny tile base.
- The bathroom’s only window faces north, and rarely lets in direct light — perhaps contributing to the preservation of this antique space.
