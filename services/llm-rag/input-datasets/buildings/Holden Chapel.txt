Holden Chapel is a small building in Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University . Completed in 1744, it is the third oldest building at Harvard and one of the oldest college buildings in America. [ citation needed ] In December 1741, Mrs. Samuel Holden , the widow of a former Governor of the Bank of England , offered Harvard a 400 pound sterling donation towards the construction of a chapel on campus, prompted by a suggestion from Thomas Hutchinson . After additional funds were raised, the chapel opened in March 1745. From 1744 to 1772 (except for 1767–68) the chapel housed morning and evening prayers for the Harvard student body, as well as providing space for some secular uses such as lectures. After the 1783 establishment of the Harvard Medical School , the building was used by its founder, John Warren , on a regular basis for 19 years, and intermittently by him and others thereafter until 1825. It faces the Class of 1870 Gate, and a sundial inscribed "On This Moment Hangs Eternity." In the 1930s, Holden Chapel (and Hollis Hall ) were chosen by the Historical American Buildings Survey Commission as two of the finest examples of early Colonial architecture in Massachusetts For much of the 20th century, Holden Chapel housed the student offices of the Harvard Glee Club and later the Radcliffe Choral Society and the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum , which collectively came to be known as the Holden Choirs . The chapel was remodeled in 1999 to serve as both a classroom and a musical rehearsal and performance space. Though no longer housing the Holden Choirs' offices, Holden Chapel now serves as their primary rehearsal space.

Title: Faith in the counsel of history

Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer During the first Morning Prayers of the new academic term, Harvard President Drew Faust outlined her hopes for the future by turning her eye to the past and calling on her listeners to do the same. “A concern for the future requires us all to commit to exploring the past — to in some measure be historians,” Faust said Wednesday morning. In keeping with tradition, Faust delivered her comments at the opening service of the year, a daily ritual of reflection, prayer, scripture, and song on Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters. At the dais, Faust stepped back from her role as president, instead speaking as a scholar of the past. Studying history has made her a better leader, said Faust. She called her academic work “in many ways the ideal training for leadership,” helping her understand what makes change happen, who embraces it, who doesn’t, and why. History has also helped her understand that “things could have been otherwise” and that “we have the power to make things otherwise.” Faust said she also has gained from her field of study and research a “profound humility,” and empathy. “Studying history has diminished my eagerness to judge or condemn people — in the past or present — and has enhanced my desire, and I hope my capacity, to understand, to see the world through others’ eyes.” With renovations in progress at the Memorial Church , the ceremony was moved from Appleton Chapel to Holden Chapel, which is nestled in the Old Yard behind Harvard Hall and the freshman dorm Hollis, once barracks for George Washington’s troops and later the site of Harvard Medical School . Faust reminded listeners that Harvard, like many other universities across the country, lately has been examining its own, often painful history. In March, Harvard Law School , with approval from the Harvard Corporation, dropped from its seal the family crest of a slaveholder. In April, Faust, accompanied by congressman and Civil Rights icon John Lewis, dedicated a plaque on Wadsworth House in honor of four slaves who worked in the households of two Harvard presidents. In March 2017 the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study will host a conference on slavery and universities. “We must understand how our narratives about the past have shaped and continue to shape the present in order to be able to transform that present into a better, juster future. We must seize the agency that the insights of history can provide us,” said Faust. “We must all be historians. Who we are is indelibly shaped by who we have been. In William Faulkner’s oft-quoted words: ‘The past is never dead; it’s not even past.’ It is instead the essential material with which we can build a better future.” Jonathan Walton, Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, closed the service with a benediction that included his own nod to history. He told the crowd, “The way forward is often back through with our God that has kept us in ages past.” Morning Prayers will be held at Holden Chapel through the academic term.

“We had areas of the Yard that we just felt could look a little better, and we wanted students to have a chance to feel involved with their environment,” said Dean of Freshmen Tom Dingman (left).

Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Jennifer Doody Harvard Correspondent As the sun broke through cloudy skies for the first time in days, a group of Harvard students rolled up their sleeves and joined forces with staff and administrators to make Harvard Yard a more beautiful space on Friday. For the second consecutive year, Harvard’s landscaping staff brought trees, shrubs, boxes of bulbs, and a new bench to Harvard Yard. With their help, students, proctors, and administrators transformed the space into a more inviting setting. This year, the Freshman Dean’s Office , which coordinates the event, selected the area around Holden Chapel, Lionel Hall, and Mower Hall for some sprucing up. A $3,000 contribution from a Harvard College fund, which was presented by College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds , made the project possible. “We had areas of the Yard that we just felt could look a little better, and we wanted students to have a chance to feel involved with their environment,” said Dean of Freshmen Tom Dingman, as he dug a hole for a tree outside the entrance of Holden Chapel. “It’s a great way to meet other classmates, make an impact, beautify their new home … and get their hands dirty.” Outside Holden Chapel, freshman Rosalie Nathans dug a hole for a shrub while fellow freshman Mica Yoder planted some bulbs. “I saw it was supposed to be a beautiful, sunny day, and thought it would be a great way to get outside,” Nathans said as she drove her shovel into the dirt. “It’s cool because they’re giving us the plants, but encouraging us to decide where to put them, and how we’d like it to look. So when my mom visits, I can show her all the things we planted. It’s a nice way to make things look a bit more spiffy.” Outside Lionel Hall, several freshmen worked with groundskeepers to plant winterberry holly shrubs and Japanese tree lilacs. “It’s such a nice day, so why not help out?” remarked Mason Barnard ’16. “I did landscaping as a summer job through high school in Colorado — so for me, it’s not just fun, but also kind of nostalgic. In a way, we’re making our own contribution to the Yard.” Freshmen Harry Hild and Dominic Akandwanaho agreed that the event was worth taking time out of their schedules. For Akandwanaho, the project was an opportunity to give back. “I’m from Uganda, and did things like this often when I was in high school,” he said. “It was a great chance to make a difference — especially during my first year here, I really wanted to contribute.” Landscape Services employee Mark Muniz, who has been working at Harvard for 11 years, said the students’ involvement reflected their personal investment in the College. “I think it’s great,” he said. “Most colleges, students wouldn’t necessarily want to pitch in like they do here. But these students have enthusiasm. They really take the reins; they want to make a difference.”

Title: The ace of bass

Noted jazzman Rufus Reid is not only teaching Harvard students, but will be sharing his wisdom and musicianship with the public at two special events: a conversation with Ingrid Monson, Quincy Jones Professor of African-American Music, on Wednesday at 4 p.m. in Holden Chapel, and a tribute concert on Saturday at 8 p.m. at Sanders Theatre. Photo by Jimmy Katz © Clea Simon Harvard Correspondent Education is a crucial to Rufus Reid. The composer, bassist, and longtime teacher, who is the 2016 Harvard University Jazz Master in Residence, sponsored by the Office for the Arts at Harvard (OFA) and Harvard Jazz Bands, knows it from personal experience. “Most people don’t like things they don’t know,” says Reid, a two-time Grammy nominee. Reid himself — who studied with bassists from the Chicago Symphony — used to say he didn’t like classical music. “I was ignorant about it,” he says now. “I didn’t understand it.” Reid, who helped create the Jazz Studies and Performance Program at William Paterson University, sees that same challenge with jazz. “A lot of people say they don’t like jazz, but they’ve never really heard it. Once they learn a little bit, they say, ‘Wow, that’s great.’” Now retired from full-time teaching, the 72-year-old musician is spending a week at Harvard, leading the Harvard Jazz Bands and the Wind Ensemble in master classes. In addition, the public is invited to participate in two events with Reid: a conversation with Ingrid Monson, Quincy Jones Professor of African-American Music, on Wednesday at 4 p.m. in Holden Chapel, and a tribute concert on Saturday at 8 p.m., during which he will join the Harvard Jazz Bands (Yosvany Terry and Mark Olson, conductors) in “The Eloquent One: Celebrating Rufus Reid” at Sanders Theatre. The concert will feature several of Reid’s compositions, including the title number and two pieces from “Quiet Pride: The Elizabeth Catlett Project,” an homage to the African-American sculptor. “Ultimately, we as composers are trying to find ways to surprise the listener,” says Reid, who garnered his two 2015 Grammy nominations for “Quiet Pride.” “To surprise them — and still keep them.” Reid’s life has been a journey of discovery. Although he began playing trumpet in junior high school in Sacramento, Calif., Reid found himself drawn to the bass early on. As a member of his school band, Reid recalls, “Every time we took a break, people would go out and play ball or whatever, and I would want to go touch the bass.” While the trumpet earned him a berth in the U.S. Air Force band, he used his free time to pick up the stringed instrument. “It came to me: I could do less of it initially than the trumpet, but I would have more satisfaction and more desire,” he says. “When I got out of the military, I sold my trumpet and bought a bass.” He also began studying it seriously, earning a bachelor of music degree as a performance major on the double bass from Northwestern. The bass, he explains, “is the core or the foundation of any ensemble, whether it be a symphony orchestra or a Latin group. It grounds the ensemble. I tell my students, we have the unique ability to sabotage any band we play in. It’s a lot of power but also a great responsibility.” Since then, Reid has played bass with a panoply of jazz greats, including Dexter Gordon, Lee Konitz, Art Farmer, and Stan Getz. He credits his first boss, bandleader Eddie Harris, with teaching him how to be a professional musician, understanding the importance of everything from recording to contracts. “Being a professional is a marriage of things you have to be quite aware of in order to be successful,” he says. From Harris, he says, he learned more than “to play good.” Among other lessons, Reid credits Harris with spurring him to write his 1974 book “The Evolving Bassist,” which is now an industry standard and in 2003 was complemented by a DVD. As a teacher himself, says Reid, he hopes to impart a sense of the “collaboration and compromise” necessary to ensemble playing. “Working together, listening to one another, creates something better than any one person can come up with by themselves,” he says. “And that in itself is what I really feel jazz is, in terms of what we do when it’s done the best — it’s happening at the moment.” Beyond that, he hopes to convey a sense of “sustained passion.” “I have as much passion, if not more, than I did when I was their age,” he says of his students. Many undergraduates at Harvard, he understands, may focus on other disciplines, such as math or the sciences. What matters is the commitment. “I want them to continue that passion,” he says, “whatever it happens to be.”
