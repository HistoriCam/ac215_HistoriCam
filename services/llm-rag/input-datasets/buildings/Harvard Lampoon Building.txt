[WIKIPEDIA]
The Harvard Lampoon Building (sometimes referred to as the Lampoon Castle ) is a historic building in Cambridge, Massachusetts , which is best known as the home of The Harvard Lampoon , and for its unusual design. The building was constructed at 44 Bow Street not far from Harvard Yard and close to the "Gold Coast" of residences for undergraduates of Harvard College before the creation of Harvard's "house system" (some of them now part of Adams House ). Designed by Edmund M. Wheelwright , who also oversaw the construction, it was first opened on February 19, 1909. Wheelwright had attended Harvard University and was one of the founders of the Harvard Lampoon . Wheelwright's design was inspired in part by an old church in Jamestown, Virginia , and by the Flemish Renaissance details of Auburn Street buildings in its vicinity. The building has been described as a "Satirical Castle". During the construction phase of the project he traveled to Europe to procure appropriate furnishings and windows. He purchased leaded windows in Belgium and an Elizabethan mantelpiece in England. The building also features 17th-century Delft tiles that were imported from the Netherlands. The Delft tiles are blue, white, and aubergine . The tiles were used in a room with an open ceiling and plain furniture and timbers. The ground floor features a small entrance and a round library used for editorial meetings. The floor opens up and there is a secret chamber beneath the library (a "basement") used for "secret" events. The building features a copper ibis , symbol of the Lampoon , mounted on the top of the dome. The statue is roughly 4 feet (1.2 m) high and weighs roughly 70 pounds (32 kg). Though it was first installed in 1909, it has frequently been stolen and returned ever since. On one occasion members of The Harvard Crimson , the student newspaper and rival of the Lampoon , which issues an annual Crimson parody issue, stole the statue and presented it as a gift to the Russian delegation to the UN. After initially promising to install it on top of a building at Moscow State University , the delegation returned the statue. The building cost approximately $40,000 to construct, making it then the most expensive headquarters of a college newspaper in the United States. After the building was first constructed, it initially hosted a small store on the ground floor in addition to the Harvard Lampoon offices and meeting spaces on the other floors; for years the site housed a used book shop, Starr Books. In 2023 a major restoration project led to the installation of a second fire escape to the building, numerous structural repairs, and the return of Ludowici tile to the roof decades after its removal in the mid-1950s. Barrett Wendell once described the building as "sturdily honest as the founder who designed it, yet laughing at every turn with freakish gayety and beauty." However, the building's architecture has been criticized, most notably by former Cambridge mayor Alfred Vellucci . He once described it as "one of the ugliest buildings in the world" and claimed that "it does nothing but scare strangers" and "looks like a witch on a broomstick." He also noted that the location of the building "is an ideal spot for a restroom", and once unsuccessfully proposed a city ordinance declaring the building a public urinal . The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Vellucci later clashed with the Harvard Lampoon due to a tree that he planted on city land in front of the building in 1961 in order to block the view of the building. He wished to obscure the face of the building because he found it ugly and to avenge local Italian Americans , whom he believed the Lampoon had insulted by claiming that an Irishman (rather than the Italian Christopher Columbus ) discovered America. Vellucci's opposition was also fueled in part by the proposal from members of the Harvard Lampoon to rename a nearby intersection "Lampoon Square", and by the satirical portraits of Vellucci that they published. During the sixties, seventies, and eighties the tree was routinely vandalized, its branches often chopped off and acid was poured on the tree twice. However, in 1991 the tree was completely chopped down. The Harvard Lampoon refused to confirm or deny involvement in the event and a smaller tree was planted in its place. Three years later the tree was felled on the night of Harvard's commencement. The leadership of the Harvard Lampoon denied any complicity, and suggested that it may have been a false flag operation by members of the Harvard Crimson .

Story and photo by Rose Lincoln Gazette Staff When curator Joe Hickey found the original 1909 architectural plans for the Harvard Lampoon building where he works he rolled up his sleeves and got down to business. According to the plans, the ears on the face of the Mt. Auburn Street building shot out steam on every hour. When Hickey dug into the records he discovered the reason for the shooting steam was not aesthetic but rather to save money – and “snub” the University. The plans, written by founding member Edmund M. Wheelwright, stated that steam would enter through underground pipes from the building across the street. In 1909, bills for steam heat were assessed by measuring the steam that came through the “return line” in the form of vapor. If there was no return vapor the user could not be charged. So each time the face on the facade of the Lampoon shot steam out its ears, the Lampoon staff simultaneously saved money and tweaked the University by avoiding the return line. With ease, Hickey reels off incredible and obscure facts about the Lampoon’s past. And he proudly proclaims it as the place where the creators of David Letterman’s Top Ten List got their start, where the writers of “The Simpsons,” “Saturday Night Live,” and “Seinfeld” once worked and partied. Asked why a student chooses The Lampoon over the student-run newspaper, The Crimson, Hickey confidently replies: “If you want to become rich and famous you start at the Lampoon.” Hickey’s dedication to the Lampoon is evident everywhere around the historic building. From the recently constructed wood coverings for all the radiators to the restored Senior Dinner poster he found in the basement. The poster had a dark liquor stain covering a portion of it, and when restored, showed 1954 Lampoon President John Updike’s signature and a drawing of himself in the upper corner. It now hangs on the wall with other memorabilia. Drapes cover the second-floor windows to discourage peeping. When the drapes are open, memorabilia such as the Updike poster are visible on nearly every inch of wall space and are well-protected by the UV glass Hickey has recently installed. As Hickey leads a recent visitor through the venerable structure, he remarks on the daily surprises he encounters in his job at the Lampoon. “This place becomes their home,” says Hickey of the students who work there, “not their dorms, but here at the Lampoon.” Almost on cue, he switches a light on in a room in the basement. A student wrapped in a sleeping bag is asleep on a shelf. Hickey apologizes to the student, shuts off the light, and the tour continues. When returning graduates stop by to visit, it’s Hickey they recognize and share a beer with. Besides the returning alums, Hickey and the Lampoon staff have played host to such notables as Aerosmith, Updike, John Irving, Tom Wolfe, Phil Hartman, Conan O’Brien, and Mr. T. When the Lampoon hosts an awards dinner, gentlemen arrive in tuxedos and ladies in gowns and tiaras. Candles light the rooms. While little electricity is used for the lighting, it’s most emphatically used to power the $5,000 speakers that blare music and rock the many parties. Hickey has just two predecessors: Elmer Green, who died in 1977 with a Lampoon staffer at his bedside, and Bob Stewart, who was curator before Green and whose dedication was such that he officially changed his name to Bob Lampoon. The basement room where Green lived for 50 years (and for more than half of that time on a dirt floor) has been named for him. Hickey watches over “The Elmer Room” and all the rooms of the building and joins in the fun at every Lampoon event, but unlike his predecessors he does not live in the basement and has no plans to change his name. In 1998, when multimillionaire alumnus Bill Vogel came to visit, Hickey mentioned what he’d found in Wheelwright’s 1886 architectural plans. Armed with Vogel’s financial backing and encouragement, Hickey purchased and installed a steam generator, wiring it to a timer and once again, as in days gone by, for five minutes before each hour, the funny face called The Lampoon spews steam out its ears.

[FACTS]

The Harvard Lampoon Building, located at 44 Bow Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, stands as the headquarters of The Harvard Lampoon, one of the oldest continually published humor magazines in the United States. The building is often called the Lampoon Castle, a nickname that reflects its distinctive architectural character. It is situated at the edge of Harvard Square, roughly where Bow Street meets Mount Auburn Street, forming a triangular lot that gives the structure its unusual shape. The building was completed in 1909, making it a structure with well over a century of continuous use by successive generations of Lampoon writers, cartoonists, editors, and contributors. It was designed by Edmund M. Wheelwright, a Lampoon alumnus himself, and a notable Boston architect who also designed the Boston Fire Department Headquarters and was involved in the design of the Anderson Memorial Bridge. Wheelwright was class of 1896 at Harvard and was heavily inspired by European architectural styles, especially Dutch, Flemish, and late Gothic influences. The Lampoon Building’s small size, ornate detailing, terra cotta ornamentation, and castle-like massing make it stand out sharply from the surrounding red-brick Georgian and colonial revival architecture typical of Harvard Yard and much of Cambridge.

The structure’s main façade includes multi-colored bricks, patterned stone, whimsical iconography, carved faces, grotesques, and decorative figural elements that were intentionally chosen to give the building a surreal and humorous quality consistent with the Lampoon’s editorial ethos. The building has sometimes been described as “mock-Gothic,” “Fantasy Flemish Revival,” or “eccentric medievalist revival.” Its quirky design makes it one of the most photographed small buildings in the vicinity of Harvard Square. The building historically housed editorial rooms, secret meeting chambers, a library, writing rooms, lounges, and social spaces used by Lampoon members, often referred to as “Poonsters.” The organization has a long tradition of semi-secretive practices and club rituals, many of which take place inside the building. The Lampoon is known for pranks, humor writing, parody, and satire, and the building serves as an important physical symbol of this identity.

The building is situated on what had been considered an oddly shaped and somewhat impractical parcel of land before Wheelwright’s intervention. The triangular plot allowed for a distinctive wedge-shaped massing. The footprint narrows sharply toward Bow Street, similar to a flatiron-type geometry, though more compact. The exterior is dominated by a tower element at the Bow Street apex. Wheelwright designed the tower to resemble a small Dutch guildhall or stepped-gable structure, with a whimsical attitude intended to amuse passersby. The building includes turrets, finials, and ornate brickwork, and the façade uses a mixture of red and yellow bricks imported from the Netherlands. The use of imported materials was unusual for a student organization clubhouse at the time, demonstrating the Lampoon’s desire to build a unique and lasting headquarters. The terra cotta ornamentation on the façade was created by the firm Grueby Faience Company, which was responsible for numerous Arts and Crafts movement ceramics in Boston.

The doorways and windows of the Lampoon Building feature decorative stone lintels and sills. Some windows are unusually shaped, including small circular windows near the roofline. Carved faces known as “Lampoon heads” appear throughout the exterior. These heads are considered iconic symbols of the organization. They represent grotesque faces with exaggerated expressions, sometimes referred to as “Poonsters,” “Poon gargoyles,” or “Lampoon grotesques.” Their designs were likely influenced by Dutch and Flemish architectural ornamentation that Wheelwright studied during a European tour. A notable feature is the owl statue, a recurring emblem of the Lampoon. The owl symbolizes knowledge, wisdom, and nocturnal activity, often linked with literary or mischievous symbolism in the Lampoon tradition. The building’s owl iconography appears both inside and outside.

The Lampoon organization itself was founded in 1876 by seven Harvard undergraduates and was modeled after the British satirical magazine Punch. The magazine quickly became a venue for printed humor, parody, and cartooning. Over the decades, Lampoon alumni have gone on to influential careers in comedy, television, literature, film, and media. Notable alumni include Conan O’Brien, John Updike, George Plimpton, William Randolph Hearst (who donated funds for earlier editorial spaces), B.J. Novak, Colin Jost, Greg Daniels, Eliot Spitzer, Andy Borowitz, John Hodgman, Fred Gwynne, and many more. The building therefore served as a creative incubator for multiple generations of writers who influenced American humor over the 20th and 21st centuries.

The Lampoon Building’s completion in 1909 coincided with a period of growth and formalization of student organizations at Harvard. Prior to the building’s construction, the Lampoon operated out of various rented rooms. The new purpose-built headquarters allowed for more organized editorial production. The building originally had gas lighting, later upgraded to electric systems. Internal spaces included a library for past issues, a “Turkey Room,” writing rooms, meeting chambers known as “Sanctums,” and a basement area. Over the decades the interior has been renovated while preserving certain historical and ceremonial spaces. The Lampoon is known for rituals including initiation events, banquets, comedic toasts, pranks, and occasional interactions—sometimes contentious—with the Harvard Crimson, the university’s student newspaper. The rivalry between the Crimson and the Lampoon is among the most enduring inter-organization rivalries at Harvard, and the Lampoon Building has played a central role in many of these incidents, including pranks involving theft of the Crimson president’s chair, hoisting banners from the tower, or placing humorous signs on the building façade.

The Lampoon Building was initially funded through donations from alumni and supporters. William Randolph Hearst is sometimes cited as contributing funds that supported Lampoon operations generally, although the building’s primary financing came from Lampoon members and private donors. Edmund M. Wheelwright personally invested significant time in its design. Wheelwright was influenced by the Middelburg town hall in the Netherlands and by guildhalls in Belgium and Germany. He wanted to create a whimsical building that signaled the humor-based mission of the Lampoon while also giving it a sense of old-world legitimacy. The building’s Flemish Revival style is uncommon in Cambridge, and the Lampoon structure stands apart from the more prevalent Georgian and Colonial styles of Harvard Yard and the surrounding campus buildings constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The building’s main entrance faces Bow Street and is marked by a heavy wooden door with elaborate metal hinges. Above the entrance is a plaque featuring the Lampoon emblem. The building’s tower rises above this entrance and contains small windows and decorative stonework. The roofline includes multiple gables and chimneys. The building has faced wear and weathering over the decades, leading to restoration projects. In the early 21st century, a substantial renovation updated the building’s infrastructure while maintaining its historic façade. Restoration included repairs to the brickwork, repointing of mortar joints, refurbishment of the terra cotta elements, and internal modernization such as new wiring, heating, and insulation.

The Lampoon Building is often compared to other whimsical campus structures, such as Yale’s “Tombs,” Princeton’s eating clubs, or Oxford and Cambridge’s historic student society buildings. However, the Lampoon Building is unique in its stylistic dataset. Unlike most Harvard buildings, it does not follow the standardized architectural vocabulary favored by Charles McKim of McKim, Mead & White, which influenced buildings like the Widener Library (completed 1915). Instead, the Lampoon Building deliberately rebels against these stylistic norms. Its asymmetry, ornamentation, and playful grotesques make it a counterpart to the seriousness of adjacent academic structures. Tourists often mistake the Lampoon Building for a small chapel, a gatehouse, an alumni club, or even a medieval tavern, but the building is solely dedicated to the Lampoon organization.

Throughout its history, the Lampoon Building has been the site of numerous well-documented pranks. One famous incident involved the kidnapping of the Oscar statuette from the Academy Awards in 1978 after Lampoon members posed as Academy representatives. Though not directly involving the building itself, the stolen Oscar was reportedly displayed inside the Lampoon Castle before being returned. Another prank involved decorating the building with a giant cartoon banana, in reference to Harvard’s Banana Club satire. The building has also been wrapped in banners, strung with lights, covered in parody political signage, or decorated for special Lampoon issues. Several times the Crimson newspaper has retaliated by temporarily “seizing” the building, posting mock notices, or draping their own logos over the façade.

Inside the building, the Lampoon maintains collections of historical artifacts, including past magazine issues, early sketches, cartoon artwork, and memorabilia. The library historically contained thousands of volumes, including humor books, satirical anthologies, and reference texts used for writing parodies. The building also contains dining areas and lounges used for “feeds,” which are Lampoon-hosted meals often connected with guest visits. Over the decades, visiting guests have included actors, writers, politicians, and cultural figures who received the Lampoon’s honorary distinctions such as “Best Actress of the Year” or other comedic awards. The Lampoon has invited or honored figures like J.K. Rowling, Natalie Portman, Warren Beatty, Winston Churchill (posthumously), Walt Disney, and others. These events often involved elaborate ceremonies inside or around the building.

The Lampoon Building is a contributing structure to the historic character of the Harvard Square environment and is recognized as a landmark in local architecture guides, though it is not a National Historic Landmark. Its symbolic importance, however, far exceeds its size. The building is relatively small—often described as compact, cozy, or compressed—but its architectural detail is dense. Various architectural historians have cited it as an example of stylistic eccentricity in early 20th-century American collegiate architecture. Its combination of playfulness and craftsmanship reflects the design philosophy of Wheelwright, who believed architecture should contain moments of delight.

The interior features elaborate wood paneling, stained glass, carved furniture, and various comedic or satirical artworks. Some of the stained-glass windows depict owls, jesters, or comedic masks. Heavy wooden furniture, sometimes referred to as “Poon furniture,” includes chairs carved with owl motifs or faces. The central meeting room (sometimes called the “Sanctum”) is used for formal Lampoon gatherings. The building’s acoustics have been described as echoing, with wood surfaces contributing to a warm sound environment. Much of the interior lighting originally came from brass fixtures installed during early 20th-century renovations.

The Lampoon’s coat of arms, which appears inside and outside the building, incorporates symbols such as the owl, a book, and occasionally crossed objects representing pens or quills. The shield is typically rendered in purple and gold, the Lampoon colors. The building frequently displays a large purple banner during special issues or ceremonies. The tower is sometimes used for announcements or for humorously hanging themed decorations.

The building also sits across from the Signet Society, another Harvard social/literary organization, though the two have different missions. The proximity has led to occasional comparisons in architecture and culture. While the Signet building is more restrained, the Lampoon Building is intentionally flamboyant.

Over the last century, the Lampoon has produced parody issues of Time Magazine, Sports Illustrated, The New Yorker, and other major publications often assembled inside the building. The building served as the staging area for these parodies. Famous parody issues include the Lampoon parody of The New York Times, the Harry Potter parody issue, the Hogwarts Lampoon, and the Birnbach Report satire. Many of these issues were celebrated with gatherings in the building.

The building’s basement has been used for storage, kitchen facilities, and in some decades printing-related activities. Modern print runs are contracted externally, but editorial planning occurs inside the building. The second floor historically housed private writing rooms. Members often decorated their rooms with humorous signs or cartoons.

The building appears in numerous photographs, postcards, tourist guides, and student brochures. It has been subject to urban myths, such as claims that it contains secret tunnels to Harvard Yard (not substantiated) or that a ghost of a past editor roams its tower (a campus legend without evidence). Despite folklore, no substantive paranormal claims have been documented.

The Lampoon Building has undergone periodic maintenance because its detailed exterior requires careful conservation. Brick spalling, mortar deterioration, and terra cotta cracking needed attention during multiple restoration cycles. In the early 2000s, a significant capital campaign supported major restoration, ensuring structural integrity and modernizing fire safety systems.

The building is not open to the general public, though occasional events allow visitors. Its interior is thus less photographed than its exterior. Many alumni fondly recall evenings spent writing humor pieces in the building’s small rooms, often late into the night. Some recall pranks involving the roofline or the tower. Others recall initiation nights or “bicker” events in which new members were evaluated.

The Lampoon Building’s proximity to the street means it interacts heavily with the flow of Harvard Square pedestrians. Many daily passersby take photos, often unaware of the building’s function. The structure is often included in Harvard campus tours.

Its architectural relevance includes status as one of the few surviving examples of small-scale Flemish Revival humorous architecture in the United States. Its quirky appearance has prompted comparisons to a small Dutch town hall, a gingerbread house, or a miniature medieval guild tower. Wheelwright’s sketches show he intended the building to be “playful yet dignified.” He consulted European architectural precedents and intentionally designed the building to evoke laughter and curiosity.

The building’s lot is often described as “wedge-shaped,” leading to interior spaces that are irregular in shape. Rooms often taper, creating unique layouts. The tower room is especially notable for its tight, vertical design. Some upper rooms have sloped ceilings.

The building also has historical significance as a space where television and writing careers originated. Conan O’Brien, for example, served as Lampoon president while a student, spending considerable time in the building. Similarly, numerous Saturday Night Live writers and producers developed early creative concepts inside the building.

The Lampoon organization has often been criticized and praised for its exclusivity, humor style, and satirical tone. The building has sometimes been the target of protests relating to the content of certain issues. However, the building itself remains an iconic part of campus culture.

The Lampoon Building has served as a backdrop in films, student productions, and photography projects. Cambridge city planners have commented on its architectural uniqueness. The building is listed in Cambridge architectural catalogs as an example of “highly individualized design.”

The building’s owl statue atop the façade has been stolen or pranked several times, leading to enhanced security. At times the owl has been painted, dressed in costumes, or placed facing different directions. For decades the owl was rumored to serve as a weather vane (not accurate, though it is mounted with the ability to rotate slightly due to wind or maintenance).

In the 1960s and 1970s, counterculture movements intersected with Lampoon activities, and the building was used for gatherings. The interior collected posters and satirical art reflecting the era.

Later decades saw technology integration inside the building, including computers replacing typewriters, digital design replacing manual paste-up, and electronic archives expanding the Lampoon’s historical storage. Yet the building retains many original architectural details, including wood moldings, carved heads, and stained glass.

The building’s triangular lot is bordered on one side by Bow Street and on the other by Mt. Auburn Street. Traffic patterns give the building visual prominence despite its small footprint. At night, lighting highlights the tower and its ornamentation.

The Lampoon Building is referenced in Harvard guidebooks, alumni memoirs, architectural treatises, and humor anthologies. Its construction cost at the time exceeded typical student club budgets. The building’s dedication ceremony in 1909 included speeches by alumni, faculty, and donors. Wheelwright reportedly described the building as “a house of mirth,” reflecting the Lampoon motto.

The organization occasionally hosts visiting artists or comedians, awarding them the Harvard Lampoon’s “Best Artist of the Year”, “Best Actress”, or similar humorous distinctions. Ceremonies often culminate in events inside the building. The Lampoon has historically decorated the building for these events using themed décor, lights, or banners.

The building’s internal library once held rare humor volumes, though preservation concerns led to digitization or controlled storage. The Lampoon archives include original artwork by famous cartoonists who contributed early in their careers.

A century after its completion, the building remains an active headquarters for regular magazine production, organizational meetings, internal dinners, and creative collaboration. Its architecture embodies the Lampoon’s ethos: tradition blended with irreverence.

In current decades, the building continues to be maintained by the Lampoon board and alumni foundation. It serves not only as a functional workspace but also as a symbolic anchor, representing continuity across generations.

The building’s name, simply “The Harvard Lampoon Building” or “The Lampoon Castle,” is widely recognized. No major name changes have occurred since its construction, although colloquial nicknames fluctuate.

The building has occasionally been included in art exhibitions, architectural tours, and Harvard student photography competitions. Its asymmetry and ornamentation make it a popular subject.

Urban development in Harvard Square has changed surrounding buildings, but the Lampoon Castle has remained relatively unchanged in external appearance. Commercial and academic structures surrounding it have been renovated, but the building stands as a historical constant.

Because of its unique style, it has sometimes been cited as a building “out of place,” but supporters describe it as a contribution to Harvard Square’s eclectic charm.

Its interior historic rooms are preserved as much as possible. Some spaces are protected by Lampoon tradition and are rarely photographed.

The Lampoon Building remains one of the smallest yet most architecturally distinctive buildings associated with Harvard University, and it continues to serve as a hub of creative humor writing, parody, and satire.
