The Memorial Church of Harvard University is a building on the campus of Harvard University . It is an interdenominational Protestant church. The first distinct building for worship at Harvard University was Holden Chapel, built in 1744. The college soon outgrew the building, which was replaced by a chapel inside Harvard Hall in 1766, then a chapel in University Hall in 1814, and finally by Appleton Chapel, a building dedicated solely to worship sited where Memorial Church now stands. Standing for 73 years before the current building, Appleton Chapel was home to religious life at Harvard until 1932. Its namesake is preserved inside Memorial Church, as the Appleton Chapel portion of the main building houses the daily service of Morning Prayer. When Appleton Chapel was built in 1858 thanks to the generosity of Samuel Appleton , Morning Prayer attendance was compulsory. When attendance became voluntary in 1886, the college was left with a building that had become too large for the morning prayer services and too small for the Sunday services. Following World War I , Harvard University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell (1909–1933) combined the idea of a war memorial with the need for a new chapel. Appleton Chapel was torn down after the 1931 Commencement. The University Architects Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch & Abbott , were enlisted to design the new building, and they planned a structure that would complement the imposing edifice of Widener Library . This created an open area known as the Tercentenary Theatre, where Commencement Exercises are held. The current Memorial Church was built in 1932 in honor of the men and women of Harvard University who died in World War I . The names of 373 alumni were engraved within alongside a sculpture named The Sacrifice by Malvina Hoffman . It was dedicated on Armistice Day on November 11, 1932. The knight's face in The Sacrifice was modelled on the British World War I flying ace, Ian Henderson . Since then, other memorials have been established within the building commemorating those Harvardians who later died in World War II , the Korean War , and the Vietnam War . For seventy-five years, it has stood in Harvard Yard opposite Widener Library as a physical reminder of Harvard's spiritual heritage. Since its inception, the Harvard Memorial Church has had weekly choral music provided at its Sunday services by the Harvard University Choir , which is composed of both graduate and undergraduate students in the university. A 7,000 pounds (3,200 kg) bell cast in 1926 by the John Taylor & Co foundry in London was used to call students to classes and to morning prayers each morning. The bell, inscribed "In memory of the voices that are hushed," honors students who died in World War I. The bell cracked in 2011, and university officials determined that it could not be repaired. However, in 2017 a restoration was successfully completed, and the bell was placed on display on the west portico of the Memorial Church. 42°22′30″N 71°06′58″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.3749095°N 71.1161574°W ﻿ / 42.3749095; -71.1161574

Photos by Jeffrey Blackwell/Harvard University Jeffrey Blackwell Memorial Church Communications The annual Christmas carol service at Harvard stands as an unfaltering tradition for more than a century in times of peace and world war, prosperity and depression, health and pandemic, social harmony and upheaval. On Christmas Eve, the Memorial Church and the Harvard University Choir will continue this rite of the holiday season in an online service featuring student voices recorded individually from across the country and around the world, digitally stitched together in a video performance of the seasonal carols. “Members of the Harvard University Choir, under the direction of Edward Jones, have been working all semester to create this service,” said Stephanie Paulsell, interim Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church and the Susan Shallcross Swartz Professor of the Practice of Christian Studies at the Harvard Divinity School. “Carol services have been held at Harvard through times of war and plague and stress, and thanks to our dedicated musicians there will be one this year as well.” https://youtu.be/HjIPgW1i_Tw The 111th Annual Christmas Carol Service is scheduled for 5 p.m., Dec. 24 o n the Memorial Church website , YouTube channel , and Facebook page . The hourlong service of readings and music is free and open to the public. Online donations will be accepted through the Phillips Brooks House Association in support of Y2Y Harvard Square youth homeless shelter and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter for adults. The carol service tradition dates back to 1910, established by University Organist and Choirmaster Archibald T. Davison, and Edward C. Moore, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals. Each year the service begins with “ Adeste, fideles ” sung in Latin by the Harvard University Choir. The singing of “Silent Night” by the choir and congregation is also a long-standing tradition. This year’s service will retain many traditions of the past, but because of the pandemic, will be a very different experience for members of the choir, clergy and the audience. The service will include nine carols sung by the choir, four congregational hymns pulled from past years’ videos, three readings and a short sermon by Paulsell. The introduction of a new commissioned carol is also part of the tradition. This year, Carson Cooman ’04, research assistant and resident composer at the Memorial Church, has written a new carol, “Legend of the Little Child,” to premiere in the service. “It will certainly have a different feel, but hopefully not a completely different experience as I think the aesthetic is the same: to celebrate through song and word the joy of the season,” said Edward Jones, Gund University Organist and Choirmaster. “And while I lament not being in communion with our singers and congregation physically, I think there are certain positives about this format.” This unique academic year did provide an opportunity to schedule the carol service on Christmas Eve, and gave past generations of choir members an opportunity to participate in choral singing, Jones said. “Usually, bound by Harvard’s academic calendar, we do our services towards the beginning of December, but this year we can release the service on Christmas Eve when our students can watch with their families,” he said. “Furthermore, we will include footage from previous carol services, which not only shows off the glories of a full and festive church, but makes this service truly inter-generational.” Work on the carols service began at the beginning of fall term. Because of safety precautions instituted by the University to prevent the spread of COVID-19, members of the choir attended online rehearsals each week on Zoom. From their homes — scattered across the country and as far as the United Kingdom, France , and India — the students exercised their singing voices, learned the music, and sang their individual parts with Jones leading the sessions on piano. Production of the service is a puzzle of many parts. In October and November, each choir member recorded the video and audio of their individual singing parts. The organ tracks of the carols were provided by assistant organist and choirmaster David von Behren, who used the organ at First-Plymouth Congregational Church in Lincoln, Neb., near where he is living during the pandemic. The organ tracks, student recordings and the readings by clergy are being pieced together by Media Production Center to create the digital carols service video. “Well, it’s definitely not the same as being in the choir room, but it is nice to see other people and still be able to make some music during this very weird semester when a lot of the performing arts have been so negatively impacted,” said Katharine Courtemanche ’ 21, choir secretary. “This carol service gave us something to work on and to look forward to. It’s lovely to keep our community going and to be able to sing together.” During a normal academic year, members of the choir attend rehearsals twice a week in the choir room of Memorial Church, with a social “ teatime ” once a week in the Student Oasis. The challenge, Jones said, was maintaining a sense of community both musically and socially. “It has obviously been hard for everyone: we all yearn to make music together,” he said. “But while rehearsing via Zoom has fairly severe limitations, there is a certain beauty in knowing that dotted around the world our choristers are singing the same piece of music at the same time. T he universe ’s sound waves are making the connections that our human ears cannot. It’s really quite magical.” The Carol Service is one of the highlights of the University calendar. Each year, people line up outside Memorial Church for hours in hope of getting seat for one of the two services. Carols are also an important tradition to the members of the choir, music staff, and clergy. Choir member Rebecca Stewart, a Ph.D. candidate in Germanic Languages and Literatures in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said this year’s performance is special. “I feel like every time I get to attend Zoom rehearsal, especially the pieces we have rehearsed before in person, I can hear the choir in my head so much more vibrantly,” she said. “It’s such a beautiful feeling. I’m just happy that I can pretend it’s still happening, but we are all just far away.” Jones said he hopes this piece of musical tradition brings a little joy in this challenging time. “Beloved by its members and alums, the service has given hope and sustenance to our community during the best and the worst of times,” he said. “We hope that it might provide some nourishment during this difficult period: preparing it has certainly done so for me personally, and for our amazing students.”

Title: Matthew Potts named Pusey Minister at Memorial Church

Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Nate Herpich Harvard Correspondent Matthew Ichihashi Potts , a professor of religious studies and literature, an Episcopal priest, and an active member of the Harvard community, has been named Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, effective July 1. Since his initial appointment at Harvard Divinity School (HDS) in 2013, Potts has established himself as a leading voice in his field, a respected academic and teacher — who was recently awarded tenure — and a committed pastor. In addition to his work at HDS, Potts is an affiliated minister at Memorial Church, former director of the Divinity School’s Executive Education program Making Change , and a former pastor on the staff of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Falmouth, Massachusetts. “Matt is a gifted preacher who brings to the pulpit a deep appreciation and understanding of texts rooted in his own acclaimed academic work at the intersection of religion and literature,” wrote President Larry Bacow in an email to the Harvard community announcing the appointment. “His incisive research and scholarly achievements are complemented by an extraordinary devotion to teaching, a commitment that has earned him the admiration and respect of students and colleagues across the University.” “I’m grateful for what Memorial Church has meant to Harvard and to so many individuals outside of our campus, and I’m deeply humbled that I’ve been invited to join its work,” said Potts. “The church is right at the heart of the University, and I see it as a crossroads on campus, where people can meet and have important and difficult conversations about what it means to be good, what it means to live a moral life, and what it means to be in community with others who have different traditions, and who come from different backgrounds, and who hold different beliefs.” Potts has spoken often to the University community from the historic pulpit at Memorial Church. A former naval officer who later opted for conscientious objector status, Potts delivered a memorable Veteran’s Day sermon in 2019 on the “ God of the Living and the Memory of the Dead .” The address was set against the contemporary immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and recounted his own experience as the son of a Japanese woman who was raised during the American occupation. He movingly discussed what it meant for him to go to Japan as an American naval officer in charge of 40 sailors, many of whom, like her, were not American-born. Clearly, family is important to Potts. His wife, Colette, Ed.M. ’08, and their three children often find their way into his Sunday morning messages, and they are a ubiquitous presence alongside him at church. Colette, who is an educator and family therapist, developed a children’s ministry curriculum and wrote a book called “ Love First ,” which emphasizes cultivating love, care, and community among children at church. Together, they work on an initiative called Not Sorry Productions , which does educational content, live shows, and immersive experiences designed to address the spiritual needs of its participants. Perhaps most famously, Not Sorry also produces podcasts, including “ Harry Potter and the Sacred Text ,” which Matt Potts co-hosts with Vanessa Zoltan . One of Potts’ most popular courses at HDS is “Love and Loss,” which explores the relationships among love, death, desire, and grief, as expressed in theology, philosophy, and in contemporary fiction and film. Over the course of the semester, students read the works of authors such as Simone Weil, Julia Kristeva, Judith Butler, James Baldwin, Marilynne Robinson, and Toni Morrison. Potts will continue to teach at HDS in his new roles. “One of the things about literary writing is that, most of the time, it’s trying to express the inexpressible; it’s trying to put into words something that resists simple explanation,” said Potts. “And that can be really useful when you’re trying to think through all sorts of mysteries. Take forgiveness, for example. If you’re going to write a theology of forgiveness, literary explorations can be incredible resources for your thinking because they really reckon with all the messy complexity of what forgiveness looks like. They don’t shy away from the difficulties and contradictions and complications of our moral lives. On the contrary, they often express them quite beautifully, and in a way I think benefits theology.” Potts earned his B.A. in English from the University of Notre Dame and his M.Div. ’08 and Ph.D. ’13 at Harvard. He is currently at work on a book on forgiveness with Yale University Press, which is due out next year. “One of the things I really care about from my own personal life and that the Christian message has centrally to do with,” he said, “is how to respond to wrongdoing, and what it means to respond to it with justice, and with mercy.” Potts is also the author of “ Cormac McCarthy and the Signs of Sacrament: Literature, Theology, and the Moral of Stories .” The Plummer Professorship of Christian Morals was established in 1854 to acknowledge the centrality of moral and spiritual development of Harvard students. In 1997, the position of Pusey Minister of the Memorial Church was created as a permanent endowment. Most recently, Stephanie Paulsell was interim Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church. Jonathan Walton had held both roles prior to Paulsell’s tenure, leaving to become dean of the Wake Forest University School of Divinity in 2019. “We are all so fortunate to have had Stephanie leading Memorial Church — first through the transition and then through the pandemic,” said Bacow. “She has been a balm to so many in our community during this time, and I am deeply grateful to her for having stayed the course to see us through this extraordinary year.” The Search Advisory Committee for the new Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church and the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals was chaired by Bacow and comprised of students, faculty, and staff from across Harvard’s Schools and units and representing various faith traditions. The committee’s decision to appoint Potts was a unanimous one. “We at HDS are delighted by the news that our own Professor Matthew Potts has been named the Pusey Minister for Memorial Church,” said David N. Hempton , the dean of Harvard Divinity School. “The Pusey minister has long been an important part of HDS and the University-wide community, serving as both an educator and a spiritual guide. Matt is supremely qualified in both respects.” Paulsell, for her part, will continue in her roles as the Susan Shallcross Swartz Professor of the Practice of Christian Studies and a faculty dean at Eliot House. “Matt Potts is a minister and a scholar concerned with urgent questions of community, justice, and forgiveness,” she said. “Under his leadership, the Memorial Church will be a place where students can ask their most searching questions about faith and life in the midst of a unique intergenerational community and explore the wisdom our religious traditions offer to help us honor and protect the dignity of everyone’s humanity in our changed world. I could not be more thrilled to see him step into the position of Pusey Minister and look forward to benefiting from his leadership and his vision in the years ahead.”

[FACTS]

The Memorial Church of Harvard University—commonly referred to as “Mem Church”—is one of the central symbolic, architectural, and ceremonial structures in Harvard Yard. It stands directly opposite Widener Library across Tercentenary Theatre, forming with it one of the most iconic axial alignments of Harvard's campus. The church functions both as a memorial space and an active interdenominational Christian worship center. It was dedicated on November 11, 1932, Armistice Day, to honor the Harvard men who died in World War I. Later, additional memorials were added for alumni who died in World War II, the Korean War, and other conflicts. Its construction forms part of the major architectural reshaping of Harvard Yard in the early 20th century, especially after the creation of Tercentenary Theatre for Harvard’s 300th anniversary in 1936.

The Memorial Church was designed by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch & Abbott, the architectural firm that succeeded the office of H. H. Richardson. The church’s architecture is in a style often described as Georgian Revival or Colonial Revival, designed intentionally to harmonize with existing Yard structures such as University Hall (built 1815), Holden Chapel (1744), and the other red-brick and white-trim buildings characteristic of Harvard’s historical aesthetic. The church’s prominent steeple rises above the north side of Harvard Yard, and it is often photographed along with Widener Library, forming one of the primary visual corridors for Commencement ceremonies.

The building occupies a historically significant site: before the construction of Memorial Church, the area was part of the Yard’s open space and was aligned with the earlier Appleton Chapel, which stood slightly to the rear of the current church’s location. Appleton Chapel, built in 1858, served as Harvard’s main chapel but was considered insufficient for the size of the student population and aesthetically inconsistent with the rapidly developing architectural goals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Appleton Chapel was demolished in 1931 to clear the site for Memorial Church, and certain furnishings, such as the organ components, were reused or rehomed.

The dedication of the church in 1932 was a major Harvard event. It included the unveiling of tablets bearing the names of the 373 Harvard dead from World War I. The memorial space within the church, especially the Narthex and the Memorial Room, contains inscriptions, plaques, and books of remembrance. The Memorial Room, in particular, holds bound volumes listing names and biographical details of Harvard affiliates who died in various conflicts. These volumes are kept open and maintained as part of the church’s ongoing role in remembrance.

The church is not associated with a specific denomination but is officially designated a multidenominational Christian space operated by the Harvard University chaplains and the Ministry at Memorial Church, historically led by the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and the Pusey Minister. The Plummer Professorship is one of Harvard’s oldest moral philosophy positions, created in the early 19th century, and the Pusey Minister title originated during the tenure of Rev. George P. Cooke and President Nathan Pusey. Ministers have included notable figures such as Peter J. Gomes, one of Harvard’s most influential preachers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Gomes served from 1970 until his death in 2011 and became internationally known for sermons, books, and his role in shaping Harvard’s moral discourse.

The church hosts regular services, including Sunday morning worship, weekday morning prayers, and special seasonal services such as Christmas carols, Good Friday, Easter, Baccalaureate, and Harvard Commencement ceremonies. Morning Prayers, in particular, are one of Harvard’s longest continuous traditions, dating back to 1636 when Harvard was founded. Although the requirement that students attend prayers was long abolished (it used to be daily compulsory in early centuries), the tradition persists in adapted form, with brief weekday services held during the fall and spring semesters. Morning Prayers are known for their short format (around 15 minutes), combining readings, guest speakers, choral music, and reflection. Speakers often include prominent Harvard faculty, staff, students, and invited guests.

The Harvard University Choir is based at Memorial Church and performs a major role in services. The choir is one of the oldest musical organizations on campus. The church also houses the Appleton Chapel Choir for more specialized liturgical music, especially during the academic term. The church’s acoustics were intentionally designed to support choral performance, organ music, and spoken-word clarity. The sanctuary includes choir stalls in the chancel area, visible when Appleton Chapel is open.

The organ in Memorial Church is a Skinner/Æolian-Skinner organ, originally installed in 1932 and rebuilt/revoiced several times. Organs in Harvard chapels have a long history: College records from the 18th and 19th centuries mention earlier organs in Holden Chapel and Appleton Chapel. The Memorial Church organ is notable for its size, tonal quality, and use in recitals, recordings, and services. Over the decades, portions of the organ were upgraded to meet contemporary performance standards while maintaining its historical character.

The church’s floor plan contains several distinct sections. The Nave is the central congregational space with fixed wooden pews aligned to face the chancel. Behind the chancel lies Appleton Chapel, named after the earlier 1858 chapel but reconstructed within the new building. Appleton Chapel is used for weekday services and is notable for a simpler, more intimate architectural style. Its positioning behind the main chancel allows the church to expand or contract the worship space depending on the size and nature of services. The Appleton Chapel doors can be closed or opened to merge the spaces. It is also the site where Harvard’s morning prayers traditionally occur.

Directly inside the main entrance, the Memorial Room serves as the heart of the church’s commemorative function. Its architectural elements include marble tablets, brass plaques, and wooden bookcases containing the Books of Remembrance. Each war or conflict has its own dedicated section. The World War I memorial tablets installed in 1932 remain a focal point. The World War II memorial additions came later, unveiled in the 1950s. Korean War memorial plaques were added later still. Several inscriptions line the walls, including biblical texts and quotations emphasizing sacrifice, service, and remembrance.

A major feature of Memorial Church is its role in Commencement. Every year, Harvard’s Commencement Exercises occur in Tercentenary Theatre, the open space bounded by Memorial Church on the north and Widener Library on the south. The morning Commencement Exercises (with speeches such as the President’s Annual Report and the Latin Salutatory) use Memorial Church as a ceremonial backdrop, while Baccalaureate Service (the day before) specifically uses the church interior. During Baccalaureate, the graduating class processes into the church, participants sing traditional hymns, and the President of Harvard addresses the class. This ceremony is one of the few times the entire senior class gathers in one indoor space.

The church’s façade features Flemish bond brickwork, white-painted wood trim, and large windows arranged symmetrically. Pilasters and a pediment decorate the main entrance. The steeple, rising above the south side of the building, includes a base, tower, belfry, octagonal lantern, and spire—following classical New England ecclesiastical design. The steeple’s style is sometimes compared to that of Christ Church in Cambridge (the “Old North Cambridge” church designed by Peter Harrison), though Memorial Church’s proportions and details differ.

When Harvard celebrated its Tercentenary in 1936, Memorial Church was only four years old but already regarded as one of the Yard’s central landmarks. The dedication ceremonies during that celebration used the church grounds extensively. The creation of Tercentenary Theatre simultaneously gave the church a permanent role as a backdrop for major university events.

Although the church is Christian in origin and function, Harvard has always maintained distinction between religious ritual and university governance. After the early colonial period when all students were required to attend daily prayers and Sunday worship as part of Puritan educational philosophy, Harvard gradually secularized. By the 19th century, Appleton Chapel was essentially a quasi-secular worship space used for non-denominational Protestant worship. By the 20th century, the university officially became religiously nonsectarian. As a result, Memorial Church was conceived as a Christian space within a pluralistic university, not as a central religious authority. Harvard’s Office of the Chaplaincy includes chaplains from many traditions, and Memorial Church houses only the Christian ministry.

Early plans for the building show the intention to balance its commemorative and worship functions. The architectural program included specific instructions regarding the inscriptions, memorial tablets, and Books of Remembrance. Many of the names engraved in stone correspond to Harvard alumni who were involved in major historical events of the early 20th century. Some individuals were notable athletes, Rhodes Scholars, future public leaders, or members of historic Harvard families. The memorialization contributed to the broader American tradition of “living memorials”—public buildings constructed for use but dedicated to fallen soldiers.

The church’s interior woodwork includes paneling, carved moldings, and decorative elements consistent with the Georgian Revival. The pews are original to the building’s dedication. The floors include marble sections near the chancel and stone or tile surfaces near entryways. Lighting fixtures were originally electrified in the early 20th-century style and have been updated for safety while preserving their historical appearance.

The Memorial Church underwent significant renovations in the early 21st century. These renovations included accessibility improvements, structural reinforcements, upgrades to heating and cooling systems, and restoration of architectural details. The Appleton Chapel organ underwent restoration as well. Renovations also enhanced the church’s utility for major events such as Commencement, ensuring that the building could support modern audio systems, livestreaming, and lighting without altering its historical character.

The church is governed administratively by the Harvard College Office, the Ministry at Memorial Church, and other university planning offices. It functions as a venue for weddings, funerals, concerts, memorial services, vigils, and community gatherings. Many Harvard alumni choose to hold weddings there due to its location and significance; unlike some Harvard buildings, Memorial Church is commonly accessible for such ceremonies with advance arrangement.

The surrounding area includes Tercentenary Theatre, the broad grassy expanse used for large gatherings. The space between Widener Library and Memorial Church is one of the most iconic at Harvard. Photographs of Commencement, Freshman Convocation, major rallies, and university speeches routinely use the church’s façade as a backdrop. The church thus plays a dual role: an intimate interior space for reflection and a public exterior landmark for institutional ceremony.

The Memorial Church stands very close to Sever Hall, University Hall, Grays Hall, and Weld Hall. Its presence reshaped pedestrian traffic through the Yard after its construction, as its footprint occupies what was once part of a larger open lawn. Its placement intentionally complements Widener Library, producing a formal axis that strengthened the south–north symmetry of the Yard. The design supports processional lines, such as those used in Commencement.

The church’s bell is used for a variety of ceremonial tolls, including marking significant university losses. At times, the bell has tolled for national tragedies or in solidarity events, bringing students and community members together.

The church also hosts academic talks, discussions, and secular programs. Although primarily a worship and memorial building, it is integrated into campus life beyond religious services. Student groups occasionally use its meeting rooms for events compatible with the church’s mission and regulations.

Within the Memorial Room, the Books of Remembrance are maintained by staff who ensure that pages are turned regularly to prevent light damage and to give equal visibility to all names. Binding materials include archival-grade paper and leather covers. The names recorded cover World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and in some cases, later conflicts or university-affiliated losses. Harvard’s approach to memorialization is intentionally comprehensive, capturing not only the names but also unit information, graduation years, and biographical notes.

The church grounds include plaques and markers outside the building as well. Some commemorate donors or significant Harvard figures involved in the church’s creation. Landscaping in the 1930s created a relatively open space leading up to the façade, though trees and plantings have changed over time. Between the 20th and 21st centuries, the Yard's landscaping underwent multiple updates, altering sightlines between the church and nearby buildings but preserving the main axis toward Widener Library.

The steeple, a key element of the design, is often illuminated during nighttime events. The light reveals architectural detailing such as the louvered openings in the belfry, the cupola above it, and the subtle column moldings echoing classical precedents. The spire is capped with a weathervane. The structure is engineered to withstand New England weather and was reinforced during later renovations.

Historically, the congregation included Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, staff, and community members from Cambridge and Boston. During the mid-20th century, attendance fluctuated but remained strong due to the influence of popular ministers such as Peter Gomes. Gomes’ sermons attracted large Sunday crowds, including many non-Harvard visitors. Gomes was known for blending theological scholarship with social commentary, addressing themes such as civil rights, ethics, personal responsibility, and the role of faith in academic life. He authored books from his office adjacent to the church and taught courses on morality and literature.

Following Gomes’ death, interim and permanent ministers continued his legacy. Services adapted for modern students, sometimes incorporating contemporary music alongside traditional hymns. The church has explored partnerships with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, the First Year Experience office, and campus groups promoting mental health and well-being.

The church also houses memorials beyond the major wars. Certain plaques commemorate individuals who died in service-related accidents or in humanitarian missions. The church maintains a tradition of updating memorial spaces to reflect Harvard’s evolving understanding of service and sacrifice.

The ceiling of the nave is a plaster barrel vault with restrained classical ornamentation. Large chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and the windows admit natural light that gives the interior a warm character. Window glass includes clear panes rather than stained glass—an intentional design choice to align with New England Protestant architectural traditions. The lack of stained glass keeps the interior brightness high and emphasizes simplicity.

The chancel contains a communion table, pulpit, and lectern. The pulpit is used for preaching during Sunday services. The lectern is used for scripture readings, academic addresses, and ceremonial presentations. During Commencement-related services, the chancel is decorated with banners, flowers, and university symbols.

Acoustic design includes wooden surfaces, high ceilings, and minimal carpeting to preserve resonance. The church is well suited to choir and organ performance, and recordings made in the space include Christmas concert albums and classical organ recitals.

The church is directly associated with several longstanding traditions: Advent services, Easter Sunrise services, Thanksgiving programs, Memorial Day observances, and All Souls’ Day remembrances. During significant global events, Harvard has used the church as a gathering place for reflection, mourning, or solidarity. After 9/11, for example, the church was the site of a major campus vigil.

The building is listed in Harvard’s database of historically significant structures and appears in architectural surveys of Cambridge. It is regularly included in campus tours for prospective students and visitors.
