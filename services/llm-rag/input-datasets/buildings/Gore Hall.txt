Gore Hall was a historic building on the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts , designed by Richard Bond . Gore Hall was Harvard's first dedicated library building, a Gothic Revival structure built in 1838 of Quincy granite and named in honor of Harvard graduate and Massachusetts Governor Christopher Gore . In 1846, Harvard President Edward Everett was asked to design a seal for the newly incorporated City of Cambridge, and he identified Gore and Washington Elm as two icons encircled by the motto Literis Antiquis Novis Institutis Decora . "It can be translated as: 'Distinguished for Classical Learning and New Institutions. ' " When the original Gore Hall was demolished in 1913 to make way for Widener Library , its name was transferred to a new Gore Hall, a freshman dormitory then under construction and now part of Winthrop House . 42°22′26″N 71°06′59″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.3738°N 71.1164°W ﻿ / 42.3738; -71.1164

Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Before there was Widener Library, there was Gore Hall. The imposing Gothic Revival-style library occupied the same central spot in the Yard and in the lives of students through much of the 19th century and into the start of the 20th. It has now largely been forgotten on campus save for a plaque and two pinnacles at Widener, but the memory of Gore remains alive in the city of Cambridge — at least on its official seal. Built to be the University’s first separate library building, Gore looked more like a late-14th-century cathedral than a library. It had tall towers, curved columns, and pinnacles jutting skyward along the sides.

The interior was equally ornate and defined by a series of 10 columns rising from floor to ceiling with an open space that resembled the inside of a church. The books were placed in alcoves on the side to resemble the aisles of a chapel. In his 1840 book, “The History of Harvard University,” Harvard President Josiah Quincy — who championed creation of the library — described how much of the exterior design was fashioned after King’s College Chapel at the University of Cambridge in England and that the entire structure was constructed using Quincy granite — the same stone used for the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown. King’s College Chapel. Photo via Wikimedia Commons Designed by Boston architect Richard Bond, it was named in honor of former Massachusetts Governor and U.S. Senator Christopher Gore, a member of the Class of 1776 whose $100,000 bequest funded construction. Gore served in both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate, and was one of the delegates at the 1788 Massachusetts Ratifying Convention that voted to adopt the U.S. Constitution. He was appointed the state’s first district attorney by George Washington and served as a member of the Harvard Corporation from 1812 to 1820. The new library’s cornerstone was laid in 1838, and it officially opened in 1841 when the University’s growing collection of 40,000 books was moved in. Gore was to be a landmark. In an 1841 article in the Boston Courier, editor J.T. Buckingham called it “a splendid edifice [that] will be an epoch in the History of the University, and the building itself will remain for ages a memorial of the public spirit and perseverance of President Quincy.” In his historic account of the University, which was published while construction was still in progress, Quincy predicted something similar: “As none of the other Halls of the University present any claims to excellence in architecture, the attention of strangers will probably be directed to Gore Hall, when completed, as the principal ornament of the College square.” It was true for quite some time. Gore was the central gathering place for processions on Commencement Day. It was where Harvard hosted several prominent dignitaries, including the Prince of Wales in 1860, and it celebrated its 250th anniversary there. Only five years after it opened, new Harvard President Edward Everett made the fateful decision to feature it as the central image in his design of the original seal of the city of Cambridge in 1846. But Gore was not to be an edifice for the ages. Harvard Archives holds photographs, drawings, objects, and memorabilia from Gore Library, the first dedicated library building at Harvard.

Pictured here: An architectural drawing of Gore Hall. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer The flow of books to the library surged, owing to increased fund-raising and individual donations, and Gore Hall started filling up faster than expected. University leaders warned that more space would be needed and in 1875 the Harvard Corporation approved the addition of a new wing. By then books were being piled on the floor. The addition, completed in 1877, gave the library space for 250,000 additional volumes, but it wasn’t enough. In 1895, the interior, once celebrated for its ornate beauty, was essentially gutted — the alcoves and the arched ceiling were lost — to make way for 250,000 more volumes and much-needed reading spaces. Space wasn’t the only problem. Students and professors complained in the winter that they had to wear their coats, hats, and gloves while doing research, since the hall’s sole furnace failed to adequately warm the entire building. It was also considered by many to be an eyesore inside and out, owing to the many renovations that had focused on practicality over aesthetics. In 1907, Gore was expanded for the last time. By then plans were underway to replace it. The only thing missing was the money. After receiving Eleanor Elkins Widener’s gift honoring her son, who perished with the Titanic in 1912, the University moved quickly to tear down Gore to make way for the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library. In August 1912, workers began moving the library’s 600,000 books. It took four months. When Gore Hall was razed in 1913, its granite was used to build the foundations of Widener’s steps. Those foundations were excavated in 2002 during renovations. Besides the plaque and the two pinnacles at Widener, four others were preserved and given to Francis R. Appleton, who was library chairman at the time. They are on display at Appleton Farms in Ipswich. While the image of Gore can be found all over Cambridge, digging up fond personal memories of the place, which stood for a mere 72 years, requires archival research. “I remember with the utmost satisfaction the many pleasant Sunday afternoon hours I spent in old Gore reading periodicals,” said Azariah Smith Root, Class of 1887, a former president of the American Library Association. He was one of almost 100 people who responded to a pamphlet head librarian William Coolidge Lane sent out in 1917 about the hall’s history . “I know how much pleasure you must have in your new and convenient quarters,” Root wrote, “but to those of us who used the library at Gore Hall, that will always seem to be the Library of Harvard University.”

Title: A room fit for a president

Interior designer Dale E. Holman was charged with capturing “the flavor of the way it was when he lived here,” at the request of Institute of Politics Executive Director Catherine McLaughlin. Justin Ide/Harvard Staff Photographer Katie Koch Harvard Staff Writer Visitors to Harvard could find worse places to shack up than Winthrop House Suite F-14. The two modest rooms, on the first floor of Gore Hall overlooking a courtyard and the Charles River, can be a hidden oasis for newcomers to the Square. The suite also happens to be the former home of John F. Kennedy, who lived there as a Harvard College senior. Thanks to a recent redesign of the space in honor of the 50th anniversary of his inauguration as president, guests can now enjoy the suite as he might have. The project was intended to capture “the flavor of the way it was when he lived here,” said Dale Holman, owner of Dale E. Holman Interior Designs Inc. and a regular attendee at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum , who oversaw the redesign at the request of Institute of Politics (IOP) Executive Director Catherine McLaughlin. As it turns out, the appeal of sitting down before an Underwood portable typewriter — the style JFK used — and imagining him writing the thesis that would become his first book, “Why England Slept,” just might trump the view. Holman and Julie Schroeder, a longtime IOP staff assistant, bought the rights to a Boston Globe photograph of Kennedy ’40 in his dorm room and analyzed its details to recreate the furnishings and layout of the two-person suite. (Kennedy shared it with his close friend, football captain Torbert “Torby” Macdonald ’40.) “My goal was to produce an environment that I felt JFK could have actually existed in, and still make it comfortable” for visitors, Holman said. “It’s a fine line, because a dorm room is a dorm room. But the people who stay here desire something that’s a little more luxurious.” They also want to be a part of history — a nostalgic longing Holman and the IOP hoped to harness in the suite’s redesign. They turned to the Internet to track down historical period pieces, like a rare Folies Bergère print that JFK had owned, a rotary telephone, and the Underwood, which Schroeder found on eBay for $50. Photos of a young JFK line the walls, along with a framed portrait of his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, that he kept on his dresser. Some original touches, however, were updated: Instead of a small piano, the suite’s common area now boasts a flat-screen TV. Furniture and materials for the project were provided at minimal cost by Stickley, Audi Furniture & Co., A. Rudin Furniture, Polo Ralph Lauren (linens), Pollack Associates (fabric), Oriental Rug Importers Inc., Glenn Elwell and Mark Lansing (interior painting), and Evan Mihaich Flooring. The institute has managed the suite since May 29, 1970, when the space was dedicated for the use of IOP guests in a ceremony on the late president’s birthday. At the time, it was hardly the romantic portal to history that one might expect. “It was kind of dowdy,” said Schroeder, who spearheaded the project. “There wasn’t anything that gave you a sense of JFK being here.” Still, a parade of impressive patrons was drawn to the president’s quarters over the years. Old guestbooks bear the signatures of everyone from Frank Capra to Sen. Eugene McCarthy to Texas Gov. John Connally, who was riding with Kennedy at the time of his assassination. Actor Alec Baldwin recently spent a night there, though, as Schroeder notes, he forgot to sign the guest book. Even famous skeptic Christopher Hitchens, who documented his stay for the British “Spectator” in 1985, was eventually won over by the then-bare JFK Suite. “I wanted to be invited back,” Hitchens admitted. If only he could see it now. Suite F-14 John F. Kennedy was part of Harvard Class of 1940 and lived in Winthrop House, suite F-14.

Title: Winthrop House renewal to begin

The Winthrop House renewal project will create more unified, accessible environs for undergraduates living in the neo-Georgian-style House, preserving Harvard’s deeply historic aesthetic while welcoming modern design elements. Artist’s rendering courtesy of Beyer Blinder Belle Architects & Planners Jill Radsken Harvard Staff Writer Excavators are at the ready to begin the Winthrop House renewal, which will start after Commencement. The project will create more unified, accessible environs for undergraduates living in the neo-Georgian-style House, preserving Harvard’s deeply historic aesthetic while welcoming modern design elements. A cornerstone of the renewal that begins May 31 is the addition of Beren Hall. Located at the corner of Mill and Plympton streets, Beren will contain 25,000 square feet of living space, all suites with all their own bathrooms. “Winthrop House, which was converted to a House from two separate freshman dorms, presents our team with a great opportunity to help increase and enhance the connection between students and staff in their day-to-day activities,” said Steve Needham, senior director for Harvard’s Planning and Project Management Department. Beren, named in recognition of support from Robert M. Beren ’47, M.B.A. ’50, will connect to Gore Hall, elevating student life with a “smart” seminar room for course instruction, common spaces for academic and extracurricular use, a casual dining spot, and a lower-level space for social gatherings. The architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle designed Beren, and updated Gore and Standish halls with new space for study, meditation, and dining. Gore’s dining hall will increase capacity by 12 percent to better accommodate Winthrop’s more than 400 students. All of the student living areas will also be updated to contemporary residential standards, enhancing both comfort and privacy. “It has been a pleasure to see the collective work of students, tutors, architects, faculty deans, and other University officers mature into the wonderful design for a renewed Winthrop House. Our students will return to exciting new spaces, which will enhance the intellectual and social development of our students for generations to come,” Winthrop faculty deans Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson wrote in an email. Revitalizing Winthrop’s outside surroundings is another critical element of the renewal. An expansive plan designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh, Charles Eliot Professor in Practice of Landscape Architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design and owner of the Cambridge and Brooklyn design firm that bears his name, includes preservation of existing trees, along with new trees, shrubs, and ground cover. A new generation of yellowwoods will replace ailing trees in the courtyard between Gore and Standish. The health of the 100-year-old trees, which have hit the average lifespan for this species, prompted a study by the arborist firm Hartney Greymont, which found the existing yellowwoods were structurally damaged to the point of being safety hazards. Recent windstorms have further compromised the declining trees, with the loss of major branches. Young trees with similar characteristics (low branches, multiple trunks) to the stately, June-flowering yellowwoods will be planted in the same configuration as the aged trees. “It’s been an honor for the last 25 years to be involved with replanting the trees of Harvard Yard, a similarly daunting task if you can remember the 100-year-old elms that were coming down in great numbers around 1990,” said Van Valkenburgh. “The yellowwood allee is a treasured moment in the walk to the river, and we are pleased to be able to plan its replacement for the future. The eventual effect over time will be similar to what we all love today.” Artist’s renderings courtesy of Beyer Blinder Belle Architects & Planners (image 1) and Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates (image 2) Harvard’s planning team met with Winthrop students to determine how best to reuse some of the wood in a way that honors the trees’ iconic history in the courtyard. In addition to planting the yellowwoods, Van Valkenburgh designed planted slopes to Gore and Standish to introduce new paths under a canopy of flowering ornamental trees at the courtyard margins. The terrace outside Gore, a popular place for students to study and relax, will double in size to span the length of the building. Among the most dramatic elements in Winthrop, which counts among its alumni President John F. Kennedy, is a new east entrance in Gore, an inviting, open space filled with natural light and a working fireplace. There is also a bright fifth-floor space atop Beren for performances and other programming. Two wood-frame houses on Plympton Street will be reset on new foundations attached to Gore Hall, providing living spaces for the House faculty deans and resident scholars. Throughout Gore and Standish wood paneling will be refinished, moldings restored, and lights refurbished. The renovations in the existing halls will be complete by August 2017, and Beren will open the following year.
