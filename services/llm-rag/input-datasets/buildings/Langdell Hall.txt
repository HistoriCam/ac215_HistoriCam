General Description

Langdell Hall is the largest building at Harvard Law School.

It houses the Harvard Law School Library, one of the largest academic law libraries in the world.

The building forms the northern border of Harvard Yard and is one of the most recognizable buildings on the Law School campus.

Langdell Hall encloses The Library Quadrangle, a major open green space on the law campus.

The main façade faces Holmes Field, the original open lawn used for early Harvard athletics and now central to HLS.

Historical Notes

Completed in 1907 as the flagship building of Harvard Law School’s early 20th-century expansion.

Designed to accommodate the growing collection of the Harvard Law Library, which outgrew older campus spaces.

Dedicated to Dean Langdell, whose pedagogical reforms defined modern American legal education.

A major addition in 1929 created the north wing, dramatically expanding library capacity.

A renovation in the 1950s added fireproof steel stacks and modern climate systems for book preservation.

A series of renovations from the 1990s onward added digital resources, study spaces, and ADA accessibility.

Langdell Hall historically functioned as the administrative heart of the law school before additional buildings (e.g., Wasserstein Hall) expanded campus facilities.

Architectural Features

The main entrance is marked by a grand neoclassical portico with tall limestone columns.

The building’s façade features symmetrical classical detailing, including cornices, pilasters, and dentils.

The structure consists of a central block and two wings forming a “U” shape around the Law School quadrangle.

The building is clad primarily in limestone, with classical ornamentation consistent with early 20th-century academic architecture.

Interior features include:

Large reading rooms

Multi-floor book stack towers

Less Common but Verifiable Facts

Langdell Hall was once the tallest building on Harvard Law School’s small campus until later expansions.

Its neoclassical portico mirrors architectural motifs used at Austin Hall, creating stylistic continuity within HLS.

Its collection formed the basis for numerous influential legal bibliographies in the 20th century.

Langdell’s reading rooms originally relied entirely on natural light, with electric lighting installed later in the 20th century.

The building was intentionally aligned to create an axial view across Holmes Field toward the center of campus.

When the Wasserstein building opened in 2011, it significantly shifted student traffic, but Langdell remained the research focal point.

Structural steel reinforcements were added in mid-century renovations to support bookload increases.

Langdell Hall’s basement contains climate-controlled stacks for special collections.
