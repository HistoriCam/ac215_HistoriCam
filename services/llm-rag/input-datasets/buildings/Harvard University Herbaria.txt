The Harvard University Herbaria and Botanical Museum are institutions located on the grounds of Harvard University at 22 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts . The Botanical Museum is one of three which comprise the Harvard Museum of Natural History . The Herbaria , founded in 1842 by Asa Gray , are one of the 10 largest in the world with over 5 million specimens, and including the Botany Libraries, form the world's largest university owned herbarium. The Gray Herbarium is named after him. HUH hosts the Gray Herbarium Index (GCI) as well as an extensive specimen, botanist, and publications database. HUH was the center for botanical research in the United States of America by the time of its founder's retirement in the 1870s. The materials deposited there are one of the three major sources for the International Plant Names Index . The Botanical Museum was founded in 1858. It was originally called the Museum of Vegetable Products and was predominantly focused on an interdisciplinary study of useful plants (i.e., economic botany and horticulture ). The nucleus of materials for this museum was donated by Sir William Hooker , director of the Royal Botanic Garden . Professor George Lincoln Goodale became the museum's first director in 1888; under his direction the building was completed in 1890 and provided both research facilities and public exhibit space, which were the botanical complement to the " Agassiz " Museum of Comparative Zoology . Three successive directors substantially enlarged the collections of economic products, medicinal plants , artifacts , archeological materials, pollen , and photographs . Faculty and students continue to add significantly to the extensive paleobotanical collections, particularly Precambrian material containing early life forms. The Oakes Ames Collection of Economic Botany, the Paleobotanical Collection (including the Pollen Collection), and the Margaret Towle Collection of Archaeological Plant Remains are housed in the Botanical Museum building. The Botany libraries and various herbaria are located in the Harvard University Herbaria building. The Botany Libraries collectively are a founding member of the Biodiversity Heritage Library . The Ware Collection of Glass Models of Plants, popularly known as the " Glass Flowers ," is considered one of the University's great treasures. Commissioned by Goodale, sponsored by Elizabeth C. Ware and her daughter Mary Lee Ware (Goodale's former student), and created by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka from 1887 through 1936, the collection comprises approximately 4,400 models including life-size and enlarged parts for over 840 species. This is the only collection of its type in the world. The Botanical Museum of Harvard University and the other museums that comprise the Harvard Museum of Natural History are physically connected to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and one admission grants visitors access to all museums. The Herbaria publishes the journal Harvard Papers in Botany . 42°22′43.75″N 71°06′52.52″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.3788194°N 71.1145889°W ﻿ / 42.3788194; -71.1145889

New Herbaria director studies plants via satellite and microscope for insights on changing planet Anne J. Manning Harvard Staff Writer Jeannine Cavender-Bares. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer The 5 million specimens of pressed and dried plants, algae, and fungi in the Harvard University Herbaria’s collection — among the world’s largest — must be celebrated and protected for their own sake, and for their role in deepening our understanding of a changing planet, says newly appointed Director Jeannine Cavender-Bares. “Biodiversity collections house the knowledge we have about organisms, their taxonomies, their names, and the whole histories of their discovery,” said Cavender-Bares, a plant ecologist and professor in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology . The new director has spent her career studying plant biology from the smallest physiological features to sweeping habitats made visible by advances in satellite-based remote sensing. Solving the related crises of climate change and biodiversity loss requires discovery at many different scales, she said. Cavender-Bares points to a research project she led that mapped swaths of diseased oak trees so they could be culled to prevent spread. On the cellular level, her teams examined tissue of trees stricken with oak wilt disease to understand immune response. Using aircraft, they measured electromagnetic information from affected forests, detecting sick and healthy canopies. “This is an example of how we’re moving from cells and details of the anatomy of a plant to large, regional remote sensing for management,” she explained. This and other projects fall under a National Science Foundation-funded Biology Integration Institute based at the University of Minnesota that Cavender-Bares leads, called ASCEND , aimed, in part, at training the next generation of leaders in spectral biology and its many applications. As a leading expert in spectral biology, Cavender-Bares uses the interaction between light and plant matter to reveal unique, fingerprint-like information about plants’ chemistry, structure, and cellular function. Such information can be gathered from handheld spectroradiometers measuring how leaves reflect light; also from aircraft and satellite sensors, like those planned for NASA’s Surface Biology and Geology mission and the European Space Agency’s CHIME mission, which will capture sweeping hyperspectral information over landscapes for monitoring agriculture practices and soil health. Cavender-Bares is initiating an effort toward spectral digitization of herbarium specimens , not only at Harvard but among a network of academic and institutional herbaria worldwide. “We’re working with other herbaria to get all the protocols worked out and figure out the right way to do this, so that we don’t have 10 different herbaria doing this 10 different ways,” she said. The Herbaria will soon mark the 100-year anniversary of one of its largest and most important collections, the Farlow Herbarium of Cryptogramic Botany , which contains 1.4 million specimens of lichenized and non-lichenized fungi, bryophytes, and algae. Luminaries in mycological sciences and botany will gather at Harvard to reflect on the collection’s history, and share knowledge about everything from the foundational importance of fungi in ecosystems to the latest science of rusts, which are pathogens that cause plant fungal diseases. Cavender-Bares hopes events like the Farlow celebration will give the Herbaria a forward-facing outlook and underscore for the public its significance as a hub of scientific knowledge. Biodiversity collections show us where we’ve been and what we could lose, she noted. “We’re facing choices about converting our forests into solar panels,” she said. “But if we’re not simultaneously thinking about all these other organisms for the functions they provide, for the water they clean, for erosion control, for carbon sequestration — we’re going to lose them, and the potential they harbor for regenerating healthy ecosystems in the face of global change.” Learn more about the Harvard Herbaria and the Farlow Herbarium anniversary celebration on Nov. 1.

Title: On Thoreau’s 200th birthday, a gift for botany

Alvin Powell Harvard Staff Writer Henry David Thoreau wandered the forests and fields around his home in Concord, making the observations that brought him fame. He also collected specimens of the plants he found there, preserving about 820 for identification and study. That collection, which today resides in the Harvard University Herbaria , is something of a botanical time machine. In combination with the naturalist’s extensive notes about when and where they were collected, the specimens can provide insight about the changes between Thoreau’s time and now. “They were his personal herbarium that he was using to make identifications and to record and document the flora of the Concord region,” said Charles Davis , a professor of organismic and evolutionary biology and director of the Harvard University Herbaria. In honor of Thoreau’s 200th birthday, on July 12, hundreds of new images of his specimens , along with the data associated with them, are being posted online, part of a larger effort to digitize and open to the public the 5.5 million dried plant specimens in the Herbaria’s collection. “I think it’s fair to say that the data that live inside these cabinets has been dark for far too long,” Davis said. “My vision for the collections is that we make everything online and accessible to the world.” That larger effort has meant adopting a new “open-access digitization policy,” available on the Office for Scholarly Communication website , that puts most of the images — excepting those whose copyright is held by other institutions or individuals — in the public domain. “The Herbaria is the first Harvard museum to adopt an open-access policy for its digitization projects,” said Peter Suber, director of the Office for Scholarly Communication. “Lifting restrictions from the bulk of its digital reproductions will bring this unique botanical collection to a global audience, and advance the Herbaria’s mission of research and education.” The digitization project will allow scholars from around the world to view the collection online, in some cases providing enough information to make a trip to Cambridge unnecessary. “Our mission is to enrich and expand knowledge,” said Michaela Schmull, the Herbaria’s director of collections. “This includes not only displaying the richness of the collections, but also facilitating easy access to the information that was in the past, mainly due to the lack of resources, only accessible by visitor appointment or by official loan request. Today’s online access is not only giving professional botanists and students the chance to use the information for any type of research question, but enables everybody who is curious about our environment to explore the past, present, and future from any place in the world that has internet connection.” Davis expects the digitization effort to increase use of the physical collection because researchers will be better able to see what’s there and to understand how particular specimens might help them answer scientific questions. “We use these specimens regularly for DNA extraction and careful morphological assessment. Obviously, you can’t extract DNA from a photograph and some important details are not obvious from a photo,” Davis said. “My hope for digitization is not only that we unlock these resources, but that it will open new lines of scholarship and we may actually also increase attention for the physical specimens themselves.” More than 600,000 specimens of vascular plants, fungi, lichens, bryophytes, and algae have been digitized so far. While the fungal and algae projects continue, new efforts are focused on the Herbaria’s collection of dried vascular plants, which are pressed and flattened and can be represented well in two dimensions. Other collections, including the famed Glass Flowers (officially the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants) and ceremonial headdress artifacts from the Economic Herbarium of Oakes Ames , present different digitization challenges, Davis said. Those will be tackled once the dried plant collection — which makes up the vast majority of Herbaria holdings, in both number and bulk — is complete. “These collections are priceless. They’re our best representation of where nature lives or has lived,” Davis said. “The exciting thing is that we’re finding all sorts of new ways of exploring these resources, using them in ways they were never originally intended. And the beauty is that as other organizations make their collections accessible, the possibilities grow even larger.” Jonathan Kennedy, who as biodiversity informatics manager at the Herbaria is overseeing the digitization effort, stressed the sheer size of the project. “Anything you do multiplied by 5.5 million is going to be expensive or impact services,” Kennedy said. “We worked hard to shave off every second of our imaging process and to decouple the many parts of the workflow so that we could scale up or down as needed. In the end, our process should be flexible enough that we can keep access to the collection while we undertake digitization.” Interpreting the data associated with each specimen has been a particularly challenging part of the process, Kennedy said. Among the handwritten labels, some are more than a century old. “There is a significant amount of knowledge and research that goes into interpreting data that was handwritten on a label 100-plus years ago, so digitization of these resources has traditionally been a very incremental process,” Kennedy said. “However, with the growing need to make scholarly resources accessible online, as well as growing opportunities in data sciences, there are increasing reasons to make broad cross sections of our collection available digitally.” The current digitization effort is a continuation of the Herbaria’s early embrace of the digital age, Davis said. The Gray Herbarium Index , a database of nearly 300,000 records of New World vascular plants, was an invaluable resource for scholars for decades before it was put online in 1992, during the early days of the web. “The Herbaria was a lesser-known pioneer in the realm of opening digital access to collections,” he said. “This is a continuation of that tradition.”

Title: Herbaria’s use and importance grows with climate change

Jill Radsken Harvard Staff Writer There are more than 350,000 species of flowering plants on Earth, yet only 12 of them separate humans from starvation. And, Charles Davis says, two out of five plant species are likely to go extinct in the near future because of land use and climatic changes caused by people. “We really don’t know very much about most plant species,” said Davis, professor of organismic biology and curator of vascular plants at the Harvard University Herbaria (HUH) and Libraries. “And this knowledge gap feels increasingly vast because species are disappearing rapidly.” Formerly, the study of collections like the Herbaria was the endeavor of individual scientists in pursuit of a better understanding of taxonomy, Davis said. Now, thanks to genomics and digitization, teams of researchers working collaboratively around the globe can simultaneously access herbaria and other natural history collections to tackle big questions, such as whether nature is resilient to a rapidly warming world. And an innovative project at Harvard will add to that effort, particularly with plants of medicinal purposes. “Understanding what species are and where they live remains fundamental to biological knowledge, but in the face of intensifying land use and climatic changes, we’re now using herbarium collections in many new and important ways,” Davis said. Of the 450 million specimens held in some 3,000 herbaria around the world, more than 5 million can be found in the metal cabinets in a four-story brick building on Divinity Avenue known as the Harvard University Herbaria, where a team of researchers and archivists oversee their curation and digitization. Harvard’s Office of Technology Development recently coordinated a three-year research agreement with LVMH Recherche, Parfums Christian Dior, and Harvard that will support genomic analysis and digitization of medicinal plant collections in the Davis Lab at Harvard’s Herbaria. A paper framing the newly funded project published today in Current Biology. “At least 75 percent of the developing world relies on natural medicines, most of which are either whole plants, plant parts, or compounds extracted from plants. Yet despite their importance, there are not many large-scale efforts aimed at discovering new drugs from plants or other species.” “We’re generating massive resources to really go at big-picture sorts of questions that relate to these important plants of human use, which have been central to human expansions and cultural trajectories,” said Davis. “We’ve developed a new method for ‘barcoding’ species, which leverages these samples and cutting-edge DNA sequence technologies plus artificial intelligence to improve identification of medicinal plants in the field. And the digitization process will allow researchers to do everything from reconstructing ancient ecosystems and targeting microscopic invasive pathogens that affect agriculture to describing new species.” When Davis turns the compacting handle on one of the cabinets, which are as likely to hold water lilies found in New England as Aframomum angustifolium (wild cardamom) that grows in Africa and Madagascar, he is as excited as he was 30 years ago when he first walked into the herbarium at the University of Michigan. “I’ve been working with herbarium collections for a long time and, fundamentally, their main use has been to store a permanent record of the plant species with which we share the planet and understanding where they live. And that’s still really important. But these collections can now be used in a whole variety of ways that get at a lot of questions related to conservation, genomics, and biochemistry, and many others related to plants of human use. And those are, in many ways, the areas that I’m now most excited about, having taught in this area at Harvard for nearly two decades,” he said. He points, as an example, to plants commonly found in New England whose flowering times are closely tied to Earth’s warming. “When spring comes earlier, these plants start flowering earlier. But for the vast majority of plant species growing in other parts of the world — especially in the tropics — we have no idea how they’re responding to global warming. And so, what we’ve been trying to do is to bring in crowdsourcing and machine learning to gather these data and combine them into a ‘global meta herbarium’ of Big Data,” he said. Research assistant and project manager Jackson Kehoe ’22, who was a student in Davis’ class on plant diversity, waxed enthusiastically about the project, which will mobilize a collection of key plant species from around the world that have been used throughout human history for medicinal purposes. “We all have different ideas of what it means to be healthy and how the human body system interacts with plants to heal disease. And exploring that has been an interesting part of the work,” he said. “The massive amount of data we’re generating is even more exciting. As the weeks go by, the possibilities for research are multiplying.” Davis noted that of the 35,000 known species of medicinal plants, most have not been evaluated for their therapeutic value in a more conventional, Western-centric sense. “Jackson and I have been looking for connections between traditional pharmacopoeia, including not only Western Europe’s De materia medica but also ancient texts from India and others from China. So, the idea here is that if you’re in India, you may use species X, but in Southeast Asia, where species X doesn’t grow, one of its close relatives is used in a similar way. And then we can start to piece together the kind of evolutionary hot zones of medicinal plants.” “What most people don’t understand is that at least 75 percent of the developing world relies on natural medicines, most of which are either whole plants, plant parts, or compounds extracted from plants. Yet despite their importance, there are not many large-scale efforts aimed at discovering new drugs from plants or other species.” Using digitized specimens to construct geographic and eco-evolutionary models will also allow scientists to forecast how species’ distributions will change under different climate-change scenarios: “How safe are the important species that have shaped cultural trajectories and human migrations, and have we adequately gathered and preserved the genetic material that will allow us to prevent future catastrophes?” Davis said. “Plants form the matrix for all life on Earth, providing food, shelter, and medicine to humans and countless other species, but 40 percent of them are on the fast track to extinction,” he added. “We don’t have all the results yet, but my guess is that we have done a pretty poor job protecting many of these important species.”
