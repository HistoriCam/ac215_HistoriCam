The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University , in Cambridge , Massachusetts is the only building designed primarily by Le Corbusier in the United States —he contributed to the design of the United Nations Secretariat Building —and one of only two in the Americas (the other being the Curutchet House in La Plata , Argentina ). Le Corbusier designed it with the collaboration of Chilean architect Guillermo Jullian de la Fuente at his 35 rue de Sèvres studio; the on-site preparation of the construction plans was handled by the office of Josep Lluís Sert , then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design . He had formerly worked in Le Corbusier's atelier and had been instrumental in winning him the commission. The building was completed in 1962. During the mid-1950s, the idea of creating a place for the visual arts at Harvard began to take shape. A new department dedicated to the visual arts was created, and the need for a building to house the new department arose. A budget was set for $1.3 million, and the proposal was included in a Harvard fundraising program. The project immediately elicited a response from Harvard alumnus Alfred St. Vrain Carpenter, A.B. 1905, and his wife Helen Bundy Carpenter. The couple, whose son Harlow had just attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design , donated $1.5 million for the proposed design center. The donation propelled the project forward, and the Committee for the Practice of Visual Arts began to look for an architect to undertake the project. Originally, the committee had recommended that the building be designed by "a first rate American architect" who would be in the company of Charles Bulfinch and Walter Gropius, among others. However, José Luis Sert, who was at the time Dean of the Graduate School of Design and chairman of the committee suggested that his friend and previous collaborator, Le Corbusier, be asked to design the building. Delayed due to scheduling and payment conflicts, Le Corbusier eventually accepted and made his first of two visits to Cambridge in 1959. Because the Carpenter Center was to be his only building in America, Le Corbusier felt it should be a synthesis of his architectural principles and therefore incorporated his Five Points into its design. He took it as a particular challenge, determined that it should make a positive impact both on its surroundings— Georgian style houses —and in its mode of operation. He proposed to take pedestrians from all parts of the campus through the building, so that even though they might not be intending to visit it, they would see and thus partake in the artistic activities going on within it. After much debate, a site was chosen between Quincy and Prescott Streets, abiding by the original proposal for the building. The allotted space was quite small, so the completed building presents itself as a compact, roughly cylindrical mass bisected by an S-shaped ramp on the third floor. Le Corbusier's earliest design showed a much more pronounced ramp that further separated the two parts of the central mass. However, the early design created the problem of too much disruption of the central mass. This problem auditorium reconciled by using a pinwheel effect so that in the finally executed design, the two halves meet at a vertical core that houses an elevator. The concrete ramp is cantilevered from this central spine and stands atop a few pilotis. The landing at the top of the ramp is located in the core of the building and leads to various studios and exhibition spaces seen through glass windows and doors, providing views into the building's instructional and displaying functions without interrupting the activities in progress. The exterior of the Carpenter Center presents itself very differently from different angles. From Prescott Street looking toward the curved studio space, one can see the brise-soleil that are placed perpendicular to the direction of the central portion of the ramp, making only their narrow ends visible from the street. The Quincy Street view, however, reveals ondulatoires on this studio's exterior curve, which interfere with the building's curve less than the brise-soleil do on the opposite side. On the ramp from Quincy street just before entering the building, one sees grids of square and rectangles of the windows, brise-soleils, and studio spaces, rather than the curves of the two halves of the building. The building now houses the Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies (formerly Visual and Environmental Studies) of the university, and is the venue for screenings by the Harvard Film Archive . Le Corbusier never actually saw the building. He was invited to the opening ceremony, but he declined the invitation on account of his poor health. The French artist Pierre Huyghe explored the creation of the building in his 2004 work This Is Not A Time For Dreaming .

The Carpenter Center was a daring addition to an otherwise traditional campus when completed circa 1963. Courtesy of Harvard Fine Arts Library Four shows inspired by building’s iconic architecture return for anniversary Eileen O’Grady Harvard Staff Writer No one would accuse the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts — celebrating its 60th anniversary this month — of being a neutral gallery space. The boldly constructed modernist building, famously the only structure in North America designed by Swiss-French modernist architect Le Corbusier, is a “silent partner” in each art exhibition that is staged there, according to Dan Byers , the center’s John R. and Barbara Robinson Family Director, and poses a unique challenge to curators who must work with the architecture of the gallery spaces. Byers laughed, recalling how one visiting artist asked if the columns — an integral part of the building’s structural support — could be removed for a show. “The architecture being so emphatically present allows one to better understand that gallery architecture is never a neutral space,” Byers said. “Even with galleries that are purpose-built to be flexible or to ‘disappear,’ there are very strong social and ideological design decisions being made — both negative and positive — to create a space that keeps the outside world at bay, making one’s art experience separate from the conditions of daily life.” “In contemporary art, which is so focused on the present and the future, we rarely get to look back and reconsider our recent history.” Students work in the building shortly after it opened. Courtesy of Frances L. Loeb Library Art-lovers gathered this month to mark the anniversary of the center and the launch of an exhibition that re-stages four of the most iconic works ever presented in the building. “In contemporary art, which is so focused on the present and the future, we rarely get to look back and reconsider our recent history, which everyday feels less recent and more historical,” said Byers. “This exhibition offers that opportunity.” Today, the Carpenter Center is home to the Department of Arts, Film, and Visual Studies, and the Harvard Film Archive. It also features gallery space for artists. “We’re the place that is focused on the art of our time, grappling with our conditions in the present tense, that really privileges the opportunity for artists to experiment and to work through ideas in public that are not fully formed, and are perhaps not ready to be historicized in a museum collection context,” Byers said. Pope.L discusses his 2009 work “Corbu Pops” at the opening for “This Machine Creates Opacities.” Photos by Niles Singer/Harvard Staff Photographer The center was built in the 1960s at the recommendation of a committee appointed by former President Nathan Pusey to investigate the place of the visual arts in Harvard’s undergraduate curriculum. Their 1956 report described the tensions, complications, and opportunities of a visual arts education at a large research university and suggested building a center to consolidate artistic entities under one roof. Le Corbusier was a pioneer of modernist architecture and was instrumental in the creation of the International Style. The building was a controversial addition to an otherwise traditional campus when completed circa 1963, but Le Corbusier believed that a building devoted to the visual arts should be designed with freedom and creativity. The five-level building, supported by concrete columns, features an ascending ramp at its center, with an open design that encourages public circulation and allows viewers to watch art being made. Dan Byers, center director. Niles Singer/Harvard Staff Photographer Matt Saunders , professor of Art, Film, and Visual Studies, was an undergraduate student in the 1990s in what at the time was called the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies. He has fond memories of attending artist lectures in the center’s basement, gathering with other students for smoke breaks on the ramp, and crashing on couches in the studio areas after staying too late working on a project. “For me as a student showing up from public school in Baltimore with a lot of curiosity about art but not a lot of experience, it was just this magical space that felt so different from everything on campus,” Saunders said. “The building itself is a machine for generating relationships and thinking about space and sculpture and lighting.” Still from “Reality’s Invisible,” a 1971 experimental film capturing academic life in the center. Courtesy of the Robert E. Fulton III Film Collection and Archive Now, as a professor, Saunders said the center’s open floor plan encourages a shared sense of community in the teaching space. The core idea of the building, inspired by Bauhaus workshop style, is that classrooms are open and faculty are out on the floor working with the students. Each piece in the commemorative “This Machine Creates Opacities” exhibition nods to the building. From now through December, visitors can see the 1971 film “Reality’s Invisible” by former faculty member Robert E. Fulton III ’61, featuring Harvard students and faculty, and MIT Professor Renée Green’s 2018 film “Americas: Veritas,” entwining footage of the Carpenter Center and Casa Curutchet, a Le Corbusier building in Argentina. Also on display is the “Corbu Pops” installation by Pope.L, originally staged in 2009 and marked by its baby masks that resemble Le Corbusier himself, as well as the 2004 Pierre Huyghe film “This Is Not a Time for Dreaming,” with puppets enacting the center’s origin story. Moving forward, Byers hopes the center will house even more initiatives that “teach by doing,” for example staging exhibitions for longer periods of time so students can study them, or adding a space on the first floor where students can try their hand at curating in different mediums. “The center is still one of the most radical interventions on campus, and even though it’s 60 years old, feels very forward-looking in terms of thinking about community and proposing a vision for art education.”

Title: Light, bright, and modern

Editor – Georgia Bellas | Photography – Stephanie Mitchell / Harvard Staff Photographer | Music – Podington Bear Corydon Ireland Harvard Staff Writer Swiss-born designer Le Corbusier was sitting in his Paris studio on April 7, 1960. In front of him was a sheet of onionskin paper a yard wide and long. In rapid strokes, using crayon for color, he sketched a tentative plan for what was to become the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard. The strikingly modernist structure, which turned 50 this year, was Le Corbusier’s only building in North America and was the last major project of his life. He colored the intersecting ovals of the main structure in red, the sinuous center ramp in mauve, and the pathways of nearby Sever Quadrangle in yellow, a shade he always used to denote areas for “circulation.” The 1960 sketch, wrote one scholar, showed that “from the beginning Le Corbusier violently asserts the independence of his building from its grid of surrounding streets and architecture.” For instance, the Carpenter Center was set at an angle on Quincy Street, defiantly askance from its neighbors. In the same sketch Le Corbusier also used color to editorialize, to set his building apart from what was around it. He blocked out the neo-Georgian Harvard buildings around the site, then shaded them in dark brown. Le Corbusier was a painter, and that brown was not part of his visual toolbox. He favored bright, arresting colors. Once the Carpenter Center was under construction, Le Corbusier established strict color guidelines for interior finishes. The oak paneling was brown but had to be light and fine-grained. Anything painted was almost always green, yellow, red, black, or white. Colors had to be applied directly to the concrete, without gradations or toning. In the original basement auditorium space, which doubled as a studio, the right wall was red, and the zigzag left wall was white, blue, and green. The beams were white, the ductwork was green (one detractor called it a “shrill” green), and a portion of the rear ceiling was yellow. In all, these were typical Le Corbusier colors, wrote one scholar, “which one also might associate with new tractors and machinery.” The designer, who was also an early urbanist, imagined a coming era in which machines would ease life and nature would weave organically through the built environment. As for colors, it may have helped that Le Corbusier — who began his mornings with gymnastics and painting — for a time drove to his Paris studio in a pistachio-green Simca Fiat convertible. The Carpenter Center’s color scheme remains subtle, despite Le Corbusier’s modernist painterly touches. He wanted the smooth finish of the concrete to dominate the interior, with touches of color intended to draw the eye to form and light. It calls to mind the designer in his conservative dark suit and signature bow tie. Le Corbusier’s building plans were sometimes touched by exuberant hues and always color-coded — yellow for walkways, blue for glass in shade, red and orange for glass touched by the sun. But in the end, he preferred form to color. When pictures of his buildings and his paintings were displayed side by side, in fact, Le Corbusier did not mind if they were reproduced in black and white.

Body:
The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts announced today the appointment of James Voorhies as the first John R. and Barbara Robinson Family Director of the Carpenter Center, effective February 5, 2014. A curator, art historian, and writer, Voorhies comes to the Carpenter Center from Bureau for Open Culture, an itinerant contemporary arts institution where he was director. Most recently based in Bennington, Vermont, he taught art history and critical theory in the Visual Arts department at Bennington College. “We are delighted to have Jim take the helm,” said Carrie Lambert-Beatty, Harvard professor and interim director of the Carpenter Center. “This new position opens a chapter in the Carpenter Center’s history. Jim has a record as both an experimenter and a collaborator, and brings a vision of contemporary art as an integral part of Harvard’s intellectual life.” “Throughout his career, James Voorhies has conceived of art exhibitions as fundamentally open, experimental, innovative, and collaborative sites of knowledge production and exchange,” said Deborah Martin Kao, Chief Curator; Richard L. Menschel Curator of Photography; and Acting Head, Division of Modern and Contemporary Art, Harvard Art Museums. “The Harvard Art Museums greatly look forward to working in close partnership with the Carpenter Center under his leadership.” Voorhies will be responsible for the development and presentation of exhibitions and public programming at the Carpenter Center, and will teach courses in curatorial practice and contemporary art.
