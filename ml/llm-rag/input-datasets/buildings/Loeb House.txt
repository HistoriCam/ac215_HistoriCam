Harvard Business School ( HBS ) is the graduate business school of Harvard University , a private Ivy League research university . Located in Allston, Massachusetts , HBS owns Harvard Business Publishing , which publishes business books, leadership articles, case studies , and Harvard Business Review , a monthly academic business magazine. It is also home to the Baker Library/Bloomberg Center , the school's primary library. Harvard Business School is one of six Ivy League business schools . The school was established in 1908. Initially established by the humanities faculty, it received independent status in 1910, and became a separate administrative unit in 1913. The first dean was historian Edwin Francis Gay (1867–1946). Yogev (2001) explains the original concept: The business school pioneered the development of the case method of teaching, drawing inspiration from this approach to legal education at Harvard. Cases are typically descriptions of real events in organizations. They are written by school faculty members who earn royalties on their sales. Students are positioned as managers and are presented with problems which they need to analyze and provide recommendations on. From the start the school enjoyed a close relationship with the corporate world. Within a few years of its founding many business leaders were its alumni and were hiring other alumni for starting positions in their firms. At its founding, the school accepted only male students. The Training Course in Personnel Administration , founded at Radcliffe College in 1937, was the beginning of business training for women at Harvard. HBS took over administration of that program from Radcliffe in 1954. In 1959, alumnae of the one-year program (by then known as the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration) were permitted to apply to join the HBS MBA program as second-years. In December 1962, the faculty voted to allow women to enter the MBA program directly. The first women to apply directly to the MBA program matriculated in September 1963. Harvard Business School played a role in the founding of the first business schools in the United Kingdom, delivering six-week Advanced Management Program courses alongside local staff at Durham in 1964, Bangor in 1965 and at Strathclyde in 1966. It also brought in professors from the newly founded British business schools to see how teaching was carried out at Harvard via an International Teachers Program. In 2012–2013, HBS administration implemented new programs and practices to improve the experience of female students and recruit more female professors. HBS established nine global research centers and four regional offices and functions through offices in Asia Pacific (Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore), United States (San Francisco Bay Area, CA), Europe (Paris, opened in 2003), South Asia (India), Middle East and North Africa (Dubai, Istanbul, Tel Aviv), Japan and Latin America (Montevideo, Mexico City, São Paulo). As of 2022, HBS was ranked fifth in the nation by U.S. News & World Report , third in the world by the Financial Times , and second in the world by QS World University Rankings . Most full-time students study for an MBA, although doctoral programs are also undertaken. Executive education is provided, and online courses. Baker Scholars are those MBA students with academic honors over the two year course in the top 5% of their year class. HBS students can join more than 95 different clubs and student organizations on campus. The Student Association (SA) is the main interface between the MBA student body and the faculty/administration. In addition, the HBS student body is represented at the university level by the Harvard Graduate Council . In 2015, executive education contributed $168 million to HBS's total revenue of $707 million. This included: The school's faculty are divided into 10 academic units: Accounting and Management; Business, Government and the International Economy; Entrepreneurial Management; Finance; General Management; Marketing; Negotiation, Organizations and Markets; Organizational Behavior; Strategy; and Technology and Operations Management. Older buildings include the 1927-built Morgan Hall, named for J.P. Morgan , and 1940-built Loeb house, named for John L. Loeb Sr. and his son, (both designed by McKim, Mead & White ), and the 1971-built Burden Hall with a 900-seat auditorium. In the fall of 2010, Tata related companies and charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center. The executive center was named as Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata (AMP, 1975), the chairman of Tata Sons . The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million. Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus. The facility is devoted to the Harvard Business School's Executive Education programs. At seven stories tall with about 150,000 gross square feet, it contains about 180 bedrooms for education students, in addition to academic and multi-purpose spaces. Kresge Way was located by the base of the former Kresge Hall, and is named for Sebastian S. Kresge . In 2014, Kresge Hall was replaced by a new hall that was funded by a US$30 million donation by the family of the late Ruth Mulan Chu Chao , whose four daughters all attended Harvard Business School. The Executive Education quad currently includes McArthur, Baker, and Mellon Halls (residences), McCollum and Hawes (classrooms), Chao Center, and Glass (administration). Most of the HBS buildings are connected by a color-coded basement tunnel system which is open to pedestrian traffic. Tunnels open to maintenance workers only carry steam pipes to the rest of the campus, and connect Kresge with the Blackstone steam plant in Cambridge, via the Weeks Footbridge.

Title: Loeb House garden: Colorful blooms of Elizabeth Gray

Elizabeth Gray, senior associate secretary to the University, has tended the Loeb House garden in Harvard Yard since 1985. “It began as a very small effort,” said Gray. “A row of potentilla was already in place alongside the holly hedge when I started adding annuals to extend the season of bloom. Then one perennial led to another.” Taking inspiration from a visit to Cambridge, England, Gray described her plantings as “exuberant cottage-style garden,” that are “a little quirky and not too neat, with a season of bloom that starts with early spring crocus and runs until late October — including a big crimson splash of peonies around Commencement.” As a walk-to-work Cambridge resident without a home garden of her own, Loeb House’s garden has been a constant learning opportunity for Gray and her colleagues who help maintain the space. “The site has its own challenges, from part sun to maple shade, each area supporting different plants. Harvard’s decision to compost allowed significant enrichment of the soil in recent years, and the flowers and shrubs have just taken off from there.” Gray also finds satisfaction in the regulars who check in throughout the season to see what’s in bloom and compare gardening successes and failures with tourists who discover them by chance. “People tell me they stop by on their way from work for a quick change of pace as they decompress from the day,” said Gray. “Many people find that spending time around flowers increases their own sense of balance and harmony. I know that is true for me.”

Title: Military greeting
Date: September 30, 2011

“As soldier-scholars you will shape the future not only of Harvard but also the world,” said President Drew Faust during Harvard’s first-ever orientation for student veterans at Loeb House. Justin Ide/Harvard Staff Photographer Corydon Ireland Harvard Staff Writer During World War II, Harvard turned Loeb House over to the V-12 Navy College Training Program. It was there that future officers like Jack Lemmon and Robert F. Kennedy got $50 a month to earn their undergraduate degrees. That history made Loeb House the most likely venue for Harvard’s first-ever orientation for student veterans — “a new tradition,” President Drew Faust told the crowd of veterans on today. “We are proud to welcome you to the Harvard family.” The University has more than 250 students and fellows who are veterans, or are still on active duty. Faust quoted Gen. David Petraeus, who at a Harvard commissioning ceremony in 2009 said, “The most powerful tool any soldier carries is not his weapon but his mind.” She added, “As soldier-scholars you will shape the future not only of Harvard but also the world.” A panel of faculty members and policymakers — all of them veterans — rolled out a welcome. They urged veterans at Harvard to share their experiences and study hard. Introducing the panel, Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) Dean David T. Ellwood praised the group. “You made a decision to put your life on the line … when surely you had other choices,” he said. “You bring a remarkable perspective very few people on this campus have.” Moderating the panel was Meghan O’Sullivan, Kirkpatrick Professor of the Practice of International Affairs and, as deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan, one of the Bush administration architects of the “surge” strategy. David Gergen, director of the Center for Public Leadership at HKS, recalled a recent trip with then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who was concerned about a widening gap between civilian and military cultures. “You can help us close this gap,” Gergen told the audience. Developing personal relationships at Harvard is an important part of becoming soldier-scholars, Gergen said, adding: “Do crack the books while you are here. It’s a time to go deeper.” Kevin Kit Parker — both a major in the Army and Harvard’s Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics — joined the panel just a few days after returning from a tour in Afghanistan. In jeans and a polo shirt, he was dressed for the barbecue to follow on the lawn outside Loeb House. But Parker was ready to deliver perspective, too. The new students and fellows are joining a “long crimson line” of Harvard veterans, he said — and perhaps will find similarities between life in the military and at the University. “The 18-to-30 demographic is the engine [in both institutions]. It’s how things get done,” said Parker. On the other hand, a “bureaucratic, incomprehensible Harvard does exist,” said Vietnam-era Army veteran Harry Lewis, who is Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science. “But … at its best Harvard operates like a family.” He then gave the audience his email address. Scott Snook, the MBA Class of 1958 Senior Lecturer of Business Administration, described his path to Harvard as a journey from “the West Point on the Hudson to the West Point of capitalism.” The military provides leadership lessons, said the 22-year Army veteran, but Harvard will too — including the idea that it sometimes requires self-disclosure and deep inquiry into other people. Panelist Monica Duffy Toft, an associate professor of public policy at HKS, is a self-described “child soldier,” who joined the Army at 17, served as a Russian linguist, and was out of the service by 21 — with a vivid appreciation of the value of divergent experiences in the classroom. “You’ve seen a lot more than many of the students on campus,” she told the veterans. “You need to share that.” Tad Oelstrom, a 35-year Air Force veteran and now director of National Security Program at HKS, reflected on the evolution of how veterans are regarded on campus compared with even 10 years ago. “Everybody here should be proud of what’s happened here,” he said. Meanwhile, “you are being blessed with a terrific education by your nation,” said Oelstrom. “You’ve got a huge responsibility to return that on interest.”

Martin Chávez and Beth Karlan to occupy senior posts Loeb House at Harvard University. Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Martin Chávez ’85, S.M. ’85, an investment banker, computer scientist, and entrepreneur, has been elected president of Harvard University’s Board of Overseers for the 2020–21 academic year. Beth Karlan ’78, M.D. ’82, a physician and scientist with expertise in cancer genetics and women’s health, will serve as vice chair of the board’s executive committee. Both elected as Overseers in 2015, Chávez and Karlan will serve in the board’s top leadership roles for the final year of their six-year terms. They succeed Michael Brown ’83, J.D. ’88, co-founder, past CEO, and now senior adviser of the public-service organization City Year, and Lesley Friedman Rosenthal ’86, J.D. ’89, chief operating officer and corporate secretary of The Juilliard School. “Marty Chávez and Beth Karlan are widely admired leaders and deeply dedicated alumni,” said President Larry Bacow. “Marty’s expertise in technology and finance, and Beth’s expertise in biomedical research and health care promise to serve Harvard especially well in these challenging times. We are fortunate to have two such experienced and devoted Harvard citizens to lead the board. I look forward to working even more closely with both of them during the next academic year.” The Board of Overseers is one of Harvard’s two governing boards, along with the President and Fellows, also known as the Corporation. The board directs the visitation process, the primary means for periodic external assessment of Harvard’s schools and departments. Through its array of standing committees, and the roughly 50 visiting committees that report to them, the board probes the quality of Harvard’s programs and assures that the University remains true to its charter as a place of learning. More generally, drawing on its members’ diverse experience and expertise, the board provides counsel to the University’s leadership on priorities, plans, and strategic initiatives. It also has the power of consent to certain actions, such as the election of Corporation members. Chávez has built his career on using data, mathematics, software, and machine learning to solve complex problems for clients and others. He recently retired from Goldman Sachs, where he served in senior roles, including chief information officer, chief financial officer, and global co-head of the securities division, the firm’s largest operating unit. During nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, where he remains a senior director, Chávez was also a member of the management committee, co-chair of the Americas Diversity Committee, and a leading member of the firm’s Hispanic/Latino and LGBT networks. This spring, he is a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, teaching a course on “How Software Ate Finance.” Earlier in his career, Chávez was co-founder and CEO of Kiodex, a provider of digital risk-management tools, and co-founder and chief technology officer of Quorum Software Systems. “It is an immense honor to be elected president of the Board of Overseers,” said Chávez. “Harvard transformed me and guided me from my roots in New Mexico to the worlds of finance, technology, bioscience, and academe from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Under the extraordinary leadership of President Larry Bacow, and alongside the members of the governing boards, administration, faculty, students, and alumni, I will do my part to guide the University through and beyond this most challenging time.” As a Harvard Overseer, Chávez chairs the board’s standing committee on finance, administration, and management, while serving on the executive committee, the committee on natural and applied sciences, and the joint committee on inspection. He has also chaired the visiting committee for information technology and served on the visiting committee for the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Chávez, who concentrated in biochemical sciences, received his A.B. from Harvard College in 1985 and concurrently earned a master’s degree in computer science. He went on to receive a Ph.D. in medical-information sciences from Stanford. In addition to his Harvard Overseer service, Chávez is a member of the Stanford Medicine Board of Fellows, the board of trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study, and the board of directors of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Previously, he served on the boards of Friends of the High Line, amfAR (the Foundation for AIDS Research), and the Santa Fe Opera, among other organizations. Since retiring from Goldman Sachs, Chávez has served as an adviser and board member to multiple startups and projects, including the Digital Dollar Project, Paige, RealityEngines, and Recursion Pharma. Beth Karlan is a distinguished physician-scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she joined the faculty in 1989. A professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine, with special interests in heritable forms of cancer, she directs the cancer population genetics program at UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. She is also vice chair of women’s health research in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Geffen School. Until 2018, she was director of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology, director of the Women’s Cancer Program, and director of the Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. “In these unprecedented times, I’m honored to have the opportunity to work with Harvard’s leadership and my colleagues on the Board of Overseers to help identify innovative ways for Harvard to continue advancing its commitment to scholarship, leadership and education of the highest caliber,” said Karlan. “As a physician-scientist and caregiver, I bring my clinical experience and perspective to our discussions of strategies that support students’ personal transformation and promote their wellness — especially in the midst of this pandemic.” As a Harvard Overseer, Karlan chairs the board’s standing committee on natural and applied sciences and additionally serves on the executive committee, the committee on Schools, the College, and continuing education, and the joint committee on alumni affairs and development. She is also member of the visiting committees for both Harvard Medical School and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Karlan graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1978 and received her M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1982. Long an active alumna, she is former vice president of the HMS Alumni Council and past chair of the HMS Alumni Fund Committee. An authority on cancer genetics, with a focus on ovarian, breast, and other heritable cancers, she is the author or co-author of more than 300 publications, editor of several medical textbooks, and editor in chief of the journals Gynecologic Oncology and Gynecologic Oncology Reports. An elected member of the National Academy of Medicine, Karlan serves on the National Cancer Advisory Board, chairs the scientific advisory committee of the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance, and is past president of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. Her work has been recognized with the National Cancer Institute’s Director’s Service Award and the OncLive Giants of Cancer Care award, among other honors.
