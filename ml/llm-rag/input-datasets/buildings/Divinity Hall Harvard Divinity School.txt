Divinity Hall , built in 1826, is the oldest building in the Harvard Divinity School at Harvard University . It is located at 14 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts . The Hall was designed by Solomon Willard and Thomas Sumner , and dedicated on August 29, 1826, with William Ellery Channing giving the dedicatory speech, "The Christian Ministry." It was the first Harvard building constructed outside Harvard Yard. As George Huntston Williams wrote in his 1954 history of the Divinity School, theological students needed to be isolated from undergraduates lest they drink up "more of the spirit of the University than of the spirit of their profession." A decade later, on July 15, 1838, Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered his famous Divinity School Address , "Acquaint Thyself at First Hand with Deity," in the Hall. The building is a rectangular two-story brick building, laid in Flemish bond, with only minimal brownstone trim. It has a hip roof that is only broken by a gable at the center of the long side, part of a projecting central section three bays wide. The build has a pair of entrances on either side of this central section, which are framed by Greek Revival Doric porticos. In its early days, Divinity Hall contained the entire Divinity School. It was later used as a dormitory, then classrooms. Notable residents have included Ralph Waldo Emerson , Theodore Parker , and philosopher George Santayana . Its chapel contains a fine organ by George S. Hutchings , recently [ when? ] restored. Today, the building houses classrooms, faculty offices, and several administrative offices, including the Office of Ministry Studies, the Office of Religion and Public Life, and the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.

For more than a century, the building remained largely unchanged even as the School evolved beyond its origins as a residential seminary for Protestant ministers. Today, over 100 students graduate from the School each year, and the student body represents approximately 30 religious traditions and denominations, as well as some of no faith tradition. So when Swartz Hall finally reopened its doors this semester, it welcomed members of the HDS and Harvard communities separated since the start of the pandemic to a renewed building, one that reflects a changed (and changing) Divinity School. Beginning in May 2019, the building closed for a total renewal thanks to a gift from artist and philanthropist Susan Shallcross Swartz and her husband, investor James R. Swartz ’64, as well as other generous donors. The project was completed in time for students to return in late August 2021, and what they found when they stepped inside included modernized classrooms, numerous spaces for impromptu collaborations, and a new, inclusive, multifaith space. Since 1911, Swartz Hall has remained largely unchanged. The building now connects to the original HDS Commons with the inclusion of a café and gathering space. The multifaith area reflects one of the primary goals of the project — to create a building that serves all members of the HDS community. The building’s chapel was part of the original construction, and its design and details reflect the Christian-centric identity of the School at the time. The design of the new multifaith space, however, aligns with the School’s mission to not only educate leaders from all religious and spiritual traditions, but also ensure they have places to pray, reflect, and engage with each other. Occupying two floors, the space is expansive, with high ceilings that allow natural light to flow in. The movable seating, prayer rugs, and meditation cushions are intended to allow visitors using the space for any practice to feel welcome, and there is also a new, adjacent room for ritual cleansing by Muslims before daily prayers. Kerry Maloney, School chaplain and director of religious and spiritual life, said the chapel in nearby Divinity Hall has been in high demand for ritual gatherings of many kinds, and that the new multifaith space will support the growth of more. “As a School that is as dedicated to the practice of religious traditions as to their interrogation, this bodes well for the flourishing of deep, textured, and varied spiritual life in our midst,” said Maloney. “Of course, we hope that this new space will also provide yet another haven at HDS for any individual person seeking solitude, prayer, meditation, or rest. Harvard, like the rest of modern society, is a remarkably (and, sometimes, perniciously) busy place, full of commitments, responsibilities, and deadlines. It can be easy to forget in the crush of each day’s duties that we are here precisely to resist that crush, to engage in practices that recollect us to our true (or in some traditions, no) selves.” As part of the renewal, the building was made fully accessible. New elevators, specially designed entryways, restrooms, and ramps were added throughout. A ramp was added in the building’s original chapel, previously called Andover Chapel, which during the project was renamed the Preston N. Williams Chapel in honor of Williams, Ph.D. ’67, the Houghton Professor of Theology and Contemporary Change Emeritus . Williams was the first tenured African American faculty member of HDS, the first to lead the School as acting dean from 1974 to 1975, and a towering figure in the School’s history as a champion for inclusion and its multireligious identity. The Williams Chapel is where generations of students have worshiped and continue to do so during events like the School’s weekly Noon Service, which is overseen by a different organization or religious group each week. Situated throughout the building are nooks and arrangements of chairs and small tables that the project’s design team created to facilitate interactions and allow for impromptu exchanges to become meaningful conversations and collaborations. That design element has already been noticed and appreciated by students. “There are places to sit and chat outside the library or the classrooms, and it’s providing us a space to socialize, to experience each other in a way which we didn’t have the last year and which is as essential to the student experience as sitting in the classroom,” said student Swati Chauhan, M.T.S. ’22. Inside the classrooms, technology abounds. There are new projectors, monitors, cameras, touch-panel control systems, and microphones. Each classroom has an assisted-listening system and chargers. The James Room, a new 200-seat auditorium and classroom space, will transform emerging teaching and learning possibilities and welcome global conversations in real time through improved technology. Before the renewal, the design of the century-old building didn’t lend itself to current technological needs or ways of teaching. Faculty members said the classroom upgrades provide for an improved teaching experience. “The combination of smart technology and adjustable layout facilitates just about any teaching approach. That sort of versatility will always be pedagogically valuable, but it is especially beneficial in the present circumstances,” said David Holland, John A. Bartlett Professor of New England Church History. Another important thing for the project team was to preserve Harvard’s only example of collegiate-Gothic architecture. The exterior wood doors (as well as some interior ones) were restored in Newburyport, Massachusetts, by a woodworking company certified by the state as a minority/woman-owned business enterprise. Techniques used to create the original stained-glass windows 100 years ago were employed in making the new replicas. The medallions in the center of some of the windows are comprised of nearly 80 pieces of glass. An addition connects the original structure to HDS Commons — a new entrance to the building that features a café and meeting and gathering space. At the center of the Commons is a fireplace built using granite stones from the original building that were removed when new entryways were created. The repurposing reflects one of the project’s sustainability goals — diverting at least 75 percent of construction and demolition waste from landfills. The Braun Room features stained glass medallions, including a Harvard veritas shield. For Chauhan, the new gathering spaces serve as models for the religiously complex world students are preparing to serve as scholars and leaders. “When we are at the Divinity School, we are always discussing and addressing the issue of how we can better things around us,” she said. “The spaces allow us to practice what we are thinking about. They allow us to practice the values we are trying to inculcate. Only when we practice these things actively can we ensure what we are learning and what visions we are trying to create for ourselves and society can be made real.”

Title: Biggest gift to Divinity School

She needs a kind of second home. She commutes to class each day from Belmont and can’t easily go back and forth to School, so she often stays in Cambridge late into the evening. As a result, she needs a place not only to study, but where she can eat, relax, and connect with classmates. Unfortunately, she says those kinds of spaces are few and far between at HDS, particularly in the School’s main building, Andover Hall. “Andover Hall is the center of campus, but it really isn’t equipped to be a center of the community,” she said. “I can walk around and see no one or maybe a sprinkling of people here or there, but there’s no central place I can go and hang out with my classmates. Most students I know like to go to the Law School, Lamont, Widener, or other places removed from campus that are comfortable and have food. I wish Andover was the type of space that made people want to stay at HDS.” Harvard University’s only example of collegiate-Gothic architecture, Andover Hall is the Divinity School’s signature building. Its stone walls, soaring bell tower, impressive woodwork, and grand chapel all summon the School’s long history as a training ground for religious leaders and scholars. But while HDS has evolved beyond its origins as a residential seminary for liberal Protestant ministers, the meeting spaces that the School offers to students like Campbell have not kept pace. Now, thanks to a $25 million gift from artist and philanthropist Susan Shallcross Swartz and her husband, investor James R. Swartz ’64, Andover Hall will undergo a renewal, its first since construction more than 100 years ago, the School announced Thursday . The gift is the largest in the School’s 200-year history. Dean David N. Hempton said the project has the potential to transform not only the School’s campus, but every aspect of teaching and learning at HDS. “The renewal of Andover Hall will allow us to prepare 21st-century students for lives of scholarship, ministry, service, and religiously literate leadership in all fields,” he said. “It will create new spaces that enable them to learn from each other in an atmosphere of safety, authenticity, and mutual respect. It will centralize and modernize all we do to support the academic endeavor. And it will leverage technology in new ways to bring knowledge of religion to the world far beyond our little corner of Cambridge.” The vision for the new Andover Hall is of a true campus center that brings HDS’s core academic resources together with student services. Modernized classrooms with flexible spaces will encourage new ways of teaching and learning. A 200-seat auditorium will enable the School to host global leaders for conferences and public conversations on religion. A multifaith chapel will welcome the HDS community for worship, performances, and other gatherings. And the renewed Andover will have full access for all physical abilities. “Like all of Harvard, we have to adapt our spaces to meet the needs of future generations of scholars and students who will walk our halls and inhabit their roles at Harvard, and indeed the world,” said Hempton. “The exchange of ideas and knowledge — the interactions that students, faculty, guest scholars, speakers, and alumni have face-to-face — will be enhanced by a renewed physical campus.” The new Andover will also include an updated multimedia infrastructure that reflects the interconnected, technology-enhanced, multireligious reality that students inhabit, and promote research and collaboration among HDS faculty. Academic Dean Janet Gyatso knows how much new digital tools can complement and augment the work that happens on campus. Nonetheless, she says that HDS must continue to strike a balance between the “rich information and resources found online and the both wonderful and critical experience of teaching and learning together in person.” “Technology can provide amazing tools and access to knowledge,” she said. “But we should never lose sight of the deep connections and inspirations that come from working in community and proximity, and that foster value and commitment in our work.” Drawing of the Andover Hall east elevation, drawn in 1910 by M Colleus. Kristie Welsh/HDS To encourage those connections, the School aims to create communal spaces. Particularly important because HDS is not a residential campus, social space gives students opportunities for informal learning outside of classrooms. According to Tim Whelsky, associate dean for enrollment and student services, these spaces are also critical for the School’s global recruitment efforts. “Students come to HDS in large part to engage with talented classmates who are doing exciting things,” he said. “They ask often for spaces where they can connect with one another. Filling this need is one of the most exciting parts of the vision for Andover.” The project also will put the School out front on environmental sustainability. A campus leader in the effort to confront climate change, HDS has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 36 percent from 2006 levels. Renewal will earn Andover at least Gold certification in Leadership in Environmental Engineering and Design (LEED) from the U.S. Green Building Council, increasing the building’s efficiency and comfort while further reducing campus emissions. “We always work to improve the sustainability of our campus, but Andover renewal will take it to another level,” said HDS Director of Operations Ralph DeFlorio. “The project will provide efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in the often extreme New England weather. The lessons learned will provide a model for other historic buildings on Harvard’s campus, and for organizations and communities confronting climate change in the years ahead.” HDS can embark on the long-awaited project thanks to the Swartzes. Two of the School’s most devoted supporters, they have given generously for student financial aid, established the Susan Shallcross Swartz Professorship of the Practice of Christian Studies (currently occupied by the Rev. Stephanie Paulsell), and funded student programming, events, and much more. Hannah Peters, associate dean for development and external relations, said the gift will have a far-reaching effect on the School and its ongoing capital campaign. “By helping to renew our main teaching and learning space, the Swartzes increase the impact of every other gift and the effectiveness of all we do at HDS,” she said. “They are our partners in this campaign, and we are deeply indebted to them for their generosity and devotion to the School’s mission.” Artist and philanthropist Susan Shallcross Swartz and her husband, investor James R. Swartz ’64, pictured at the 2014 Campaign for HDS kickoff event, have long been benefactors to the Divinity School. Photo by Susan Young Moreover, the Swartz donation will keep on giving. As Harvard’s most endowment-dependent School, HDS has little in the way of funds not restricted to a specific purpose, such as faculty support or research. Each year, the School must draw on scarce current-use funds for Andover maintenance, a list of projects that grows as the building ages. Every dollar used to patch antiquated electrical systems and plumbing is one that can’t be spent on the student experience or financial aid. “Andover Hall is the only HDS building that has not had a major renovation,” said DeFlorio. “As a result there are currently approximately 20 large capital projects that need to be done. These include windows, roof, ventilation systems, fire and safety, accessibility, and many others. If we tackle them piecemeal, it will be expensive, very disruptive, and it could take a decade to complete. Renewal not only compresses all of that, but also allows us to step back and think about how to redesign the building to improve the student experience.” Shallcross Swartz said that she and her husband wanted to extend their support to every aspect of the School’s mission with a gift that would transform HDS as it begins its third century. “Jim and I have seen the impact our previous gifts have had on the lives of HDS graduates and the communities they serve,” she said. “We are thrilled to partner with the School in its effort to make this unique and historic building an innovation lab for the future of religious education and ethical leadership.”

Swartz Hall on the HDS campus is the School’s main campus building. Photo by Kristie Welsh/HDS At the intersection of where new meets old, and style meets sustainability, you will find Harvard Divinity School’s recently renovated main campus building — Swartz Hall. The elegant addition bridges the space between the original, century-old chapel and the new student classrooms and event space in a way that is at once modern and traditional. The architecture is not the only thing of note, as Swartz Hall has been awarded LEED Platinum certification, the highest level designated by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for healthier buildings. “Among the Divinity School’s core values are care of our environment and advancing a more sustainable future,” said HDS Dean David N. Hempton . “Achieving LEED Platinum is a testament to the thoughtful, deliberate planning and actions taken during the renewal of Swartz Hall to create a space that embodies those values. I am so grateful for all those individuals who worked so hard to surpass our sustainability goals and produce a building that our community—and future generations—will benefit from.” Swartz Hall underwent a total renewal from 2019 through 2021, thanks to lead gifts from artist and philanthropist Susan Shallcross Swartz and her husband, investor James R. Swartz ’64, Ralph James, M.B.A. ’82, HDS Executive Education ’18, HDSEE ’19, Cathy James Paglia, and the Robert and Ardis James Family Foundation, as well as other generous donors. The extensive work included installing efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning to significantly reduce energy consumption; emphasizing the use of healthier building materials to reduce the use of key chemicals of concern, such as PFAS “forever chemicals” and chemical flame retardants; diverting at least 75 percent of construction and demolition waste from landfills; reusing original granite for fireplaces; retrofitting new high-performance windows; and landscaping the area around the building with more than 50 trees and shrubs. The renewal of Swartz Hall was the first major upgrade to the building since it was constructed more than a century ago. Harvard University’s only example of collegiate-Gothic architecture, Swartz Hall is at the center of HDS’s campus and contains modernized classrooms for flexible teaching and learning, faculty and staff offices, a café, numerous spaces for impromptu collaborations, a new multifaith space and adjacent ablution room, and the Preston N. Williams Chapel. LEED ( Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ), developed by the USGBC, is the most widely used green building rating system in the world and an international symbol of excellence. Through design, construction, and operations practices that improve environmental and human health, LEED-certified buildings proactivily promote sustainability. Swartz Hall joins 144 other LEED-certified buildings on Harvard University’s campus, including 24 other LEED Platinum certified buildings. The sustainability measures taken as part of the Swartz Hall renewal will help advance the University’s effort to combat climate change and to make Harvard a fossil-fuel-free campus by 2050. Harvard University has had sustainable building standards in place since 2009.
