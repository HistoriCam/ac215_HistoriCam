The Harvard Museum of Natural History ( HMNH ) is a natural history museum housed in the University Museum Building , located on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts . It features 16 galleries with 12,000 specimens drawn from the collections of the University's three natural history research museums: the Harvard University Herbaria , the Museum of Comparative Zoology , and the Harvard Mineralogical Museum . The museum is physically connected to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at 26 Oxford Street. One admission grants visitors access to both museums. In 2012, Harvard formed a new consortium, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture , whose members are the Harvard Museum of Natural History, the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East , the Peabody Museum , and the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments . The Harvard Museum of Natural History was created in 1998 as the "public face" of three research museums—the Museum of Comparative Zoology , the Harvard Mineralogical and Geological Museum , and the Harvard University Herbaria . Its exhibitions draw on Harvard University's natural history collections. Harvard's research faculty provides expertise and programs for members and the general public provide an exchange of information and ideas. In the museum's permanent galleries, visitors encounter the diversity of life on Earth, from dinosaurs to fossil invertebrates and reptiles, to large mammals , birds and fish , and the only mounted Kronosaurus . The mineralogical galleries present a systematic display of meteorites , minerals and gemstones . The galleries also house the historic Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants , popularly known as the Glass Flowers , and the exhibit Sea Creatures in Glass , displaying some of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology's collection of the Blaschka models of marine invertebrates . In addition, a series of changing exhibitions bring focus to new research at the University. The museum is member-based, with over 3,200 [ needs update ] current members, primarily from the Boston metropolitan area. While the museum is affiliated with the Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences and receives important support from the University, it derives most of its operating income from admissions, membership, gifts, and programmatic revenues. With more than 210,000 visitors in 2013, the Harvard Museum of Natural History is the university's most-visited museum. [ citation needed ] The museum offers educational programs and has a partnership with Cambridge public schools; offers public lectures by Harvard biologists, international conservationists, and popular authors; and has a travel program where small groups are led by Harvard science faculty to biodiverse locations.

Story by Alvin PowellPhotos by Jon Chase Carl Hagen regretted that he had but one life to give for his – butterfly. George Washington regretted that his pheasants didn’t last longer, and Mugger, well, Mugger was an enormous saltwater crocodile and if he regretted anything at all, it was probably eating the horse that brought about his doom. They’re all here, big and small, furry and bony, shiny and not so shiny. The Harvard Museum of Natural History is not only full of science and specimens, it’s full of stories – some scientific, some not. The Museum of Natural History is actually three: the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), the Botanical Museum, and the Mineralogical and Geological Museum. Among them are literally hundreds of exhibits – everything from the Botanical Museum’s famed glass flowers to the MCZ’s mounted animal specimens to the Geological Museum’s many minerals and gemstones. But often more interesting than the specimen itself is the story behind it. Some of these tales are told as part of the display, while some require a bit more digging. Here is a sampling of what you’ll find there. One scientific story the museum is telling is that of the butterfly, through its current exhibit “Beauty on the Wing: The Double Lives of Butterflies,” which runs through Labor Day. Tucked away in a corner next to a live exhibit of ants tending (swarming all over, to the untrained eye) caterpillars is a large, black and green sample of the rare Paradise Birdwing butterfly. The butterfly itself, while a beautiful specimen, isn’t necessarily the most interesting aspect of its presence in the gallery. It seems that the collector, Carl Hagen, in the course of his search for specimens, became the collected. “I sent you the one and only Orni[thopetera] paridisea it was ever my good fortune to receive,” reads an accompanying letter from an anonymous butterfly broker who handled the specimen after it was collected around 1900 in Papua New Guinea. “Carl Hagen, who took this pair was afterward eaten by the Papuans ….” On the other side of the Lycaenidae is a curious cabinet, chock full of genitalia. They’re actually caterpillar genitalia, useful in categorizing species, which were extracted and preserved by the also-novelist Vladimir Nabokov, while he worked from 1942 to 1948 as curator of butterflies at the MCZ. The butterfly exhibit will be replaced by an exhibit highlighting a wide range of intriguing objects and specimens, many with important research implications, from the museum’s vast collection. Called “Dodos, Trilobites and Meteorites … Treasures of Nature and Science at Harvard,” the exhibit opens Sept. 29. It’s just a lump of iron, but it is 4 billion years old and from outer space. And you can touch it in the Mineralogical and Geological Museum. The meteorite, called Gibeon after the part of Namibia where it was found, is one of three in the museum’s geological galleries. Scientists estimate that Gibeon crystallized 4 billion years ago and broke up violently in the atmosphere, creating the largest meteor shower known. More than 100 large pieces of the meteor with a total mass of more than 20 tons have been found in the 275-kilometer-by-100-kilometer area where the debris landed. Keeping Gibeon company are two other meteorites, Carbo and Coahuila, named after the parts of Mexico where they were found, Carbo by Mexican cowboys in 1923 and Coahuila – which is actually in three pieces – in 1868 by H.B. Butcher. In November 1786, George Washington received a shipment of animals from the Marquis de Lafayette that included, in addition to some asses and a partridge, seven pheasants. Two of them, golden pheasants from King Louis XVI’s aviary, have been preserved and are in the MCZ. The birds have come a long way over the centuries. They lived just a short time in Washington’s care, the first bird making it until February 1787 and the other dying in March of that year. Luckily for posterity, Charles Wilson Peale of Philadelphia, a naturalist and collector, caught wind of the birds’ arrival and asked Washington to send him the bodies if they died so he could preserve them. “I cannot say that I shall be happy to have it in my power to comply with your request by sending you the bodies of my Pheasants, but expect that it will not be long before they will compose a part of your Museum, as they all appear to be drooping,” Washington wrote Peale in January 1787. Their correspondence includes Peale’s request – after receiving the first bird in those days with no refrigeration – that for subsequent shipments Washington order “the Bowels to be taken out and some Pepper to be put in to the Body, but no Salt which would spoil the Feathers.” He then added “And if you please to have some directions put on the box which would prevent delay on the Passage of them.” Peale’s museum became the most famous in America, but it failed in 1846 and its holdings were divided between P.T. Barnum’s American Museum in New York and Boston Museum. The birds went to the Boston Museum and, in 1914, to Harvard. If it’s history you want (and a bit of tragedy, as well), there are many fascinating extinct creatures at the museum. Along with the dinosaurs and mastodons, however, are the recently departed – species extinct or on the edge of extinction at the hand of man. One case highlights birds that have disappeared, including the great auk, the passenger pigeon, the heath hen, and the Carolina parakeet. Their stories are cautionary testaments to man’s often unthinking dominance over the planet. The Great Auk, the bird originally known as a “penguin,” lived by the millions along the North Atlantic coast. They resemble today’s Southern Hemisphere penguins but are unrelated. The flightless birds were slaughtered for their meat, eggs, and feathers until 1844, when collectors on Eldley Island in Iceland killed the last pair. Once in similar abundance was the passenger pigeon, which used to fly in flocks so large they would literally take days to pass. Unfortunately for the birds, they were good to eat and were hunted into extinction. The last specimen died in 1914 in the Cincinnati Zoo. Similarly extinguished is the thylacine, or “Tasmanian tiger.” The thylacine, a marsupial doglike predator with rows of vertical stripes on its back, was hunted into extinction by ranchers concerned about their sheep. The last thylacine was killed in the wild in 1930. The last known living thylacine died in a zoo in 1936. In another room is the big boy, Harvard’s Kronosaurus, dug up in Australia in 1932. The 42-foot marine reptile, a kind of plesiosaur, occupies an entire wall of the MCZ’s fossil room, and was the first mounted specimen of its type. William E. Scheville, a graduate student on a Harvard collecting expedition to Australia in 1931, discovered the specimen. Scheville found the fossilized bones in a limestone deposit on a sheep ranch. The limestone holding the Kronosaurus was dynamited out of the ground and shipped to Harvard, where it took 26 years to be removed from the rock, cleaned, assembled and put on display. For years after it was collected, not enough money could be found to work on the specimen. That changed when the Kronosaurus came to the attention of Godfrey Lowell Cabot of Boston, Class of 1882, who was in his 90s and had been fascinated by sea serpents since his childhood. His great-grandfather, after going to investigate popular reports of a 60-foot sea creature, had observed what he described as a sea serpent – at longer than 40 feet – swimming in Gloucester Harbor in 1817. Today the specimen – the Kronosaurus, not the sea serpent – complete with its 9-foot head and enormous jaws, dominates the room, swimming against a blue background. In the Philippines in 1831, a giant saltwater crocodile, considered to be one of the most dangerous reptile species, ate one shepherd (and one horse) too many. The animal, known appropriately as Mugger, measured somewhere between 27 and 30 feet, was 11 feet around, measured just behind its front legs, and had a head that was 5-feet-6-inches from the nose to the first vertebra. It was a formidable opponent. A French plantation owner had seen it attack a horse and rider crossing the river where it lived. They escaped when the croc’s jaws closed on the saddle and tore it off the horse’s back. The rider, a shepherd, drew his cutlass and waited in shallow water for the animal, despite advice to the contrary. After absorbing the man’s blows with the sword, Mugger grabbed him by the leg and dragged him to his death. Two months later, the crocodile struck again, eating a horse, which was the final straw. The plantation owner, a visiting American and several local people decided enough was enough. Using lances, nets, ropes, and guns they attacked. But the crocodile held them off for six hours before it was finally killed. It reportedly took 40 men to haul it ashore. The plantation owner presented the American visitor, George Russell, with Mugger’s skull. Russell gave it to the Boston Museum of Natural History, which gave it to Harvard. The Museum of Natural History is located at 26 Oxford Place. Call (617) 495-3045.

Title: Arthropods invade Harvard Museum of Natural History
Date: October 5, 2006

Alvin Powell Harvard News Office Scorpions, spiders, beetles, and their leggy kin are front and creepy-crawly center in the first new permanent exhibit in 20 years in the biological galleries of the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH). The exhibit showcases the latest scientific thinking about these much-maligned “monster movie” creatures coupled with specimens culled from Harvard’s vast collections. “Arthropods: Creatures that Rule,” which opened last Saturday (Sept. 30), starts off with a wall-sized family tree greeting visitors as they enter the gallery. The tree highlights the relationships between a broad array of creatures called arthropods. The most familiar group of arthropods is the insects, including creatures such as bees, beetles, and butterflies. Arthropods also include creatures that casual observers may lump together with insects, but which are not: spiders, centipedes, and millipedes. Though all share the segmented body, hard outer shell, and jointed legs of arthropods, they vary enough so that insects, spiders, and centipedes all belong to different arthropod classes. Insects, for example, have six legs and three body parts. Spiders, on the other hand, have eight legs and two body parts, while centipedes can have dozens of body parts and, as their name suggests, more than a hundred legs. Arthropods also include other familiar creatures, like crustaceans, including crabs and lobsters, as well as horseshoe crabs, scorpions, and sea spiders. Found in the ocean depths, sea spiders have small bodies and sport eight, 10, or even 12 legs – some of which are quite long, leading the exhibit’s scientific adviser, Associate Biology Professor Gonzalo Giribet, to describe the sea spider as “an animal that’s really all legs.” “Arthropods: Creatures that Rule” occupies the gallery that used to house the museum’s bird display, which has been moved to another location in the museum. Museum Executive Director Elisabeth Werby said four faculty members had a hand in putting the exhibit together: Pellegrino University Professor Emeritus Edward O. Wilson, Biology Professor Brian Farrell, Hessel Professor of Biology Naomi Pierce, and Giribet. Additional information Giribet, who serves as associate curator of invertebrates, said the exhibit’s title was chosen because, whether we realize it or not, arthropods have conquered the planet like no other creature. In an opening speech delivered Thursday evening (Sept. 28) in the Geological Lecture Hall, Giribet said if one were to land on Earth for the first time, there’s a 99 percent chance – if you hit dry land – that an arthropod would be the first Earthling you’d meet. If you landed in water you might have to wait until you hit the bottom, he said, but arthropods are well represented there as well. In fact, he said, 85 percent of all species on Earth are arthropods. They are the only creatures found from the ocean bottom to the top of mountains. In the flying insects, they have conquered air as well as land and sea. They’re not just all around us, they’re inside us too, in the form of parasitic species. A recent study found that one hectare of tropical rainforest canopy holds more than 50 pounds of arthropods, an amount five to 10 times higher than previously thought. In the soil and leaf litter, arthropods are the dominant organisms. They even live in the spaces between sand grains making up the ocean floor. “They live everywhere,” Giribet said. Arthropods are not just in the here and now. They’re ancient creatures that thrived in prehistoric seas hundreds of millions of years ago, out of which some eventually traveled to become land colonizers. The arthropod body plan may be the key to their success, Giribet said. Their different segments can be adapted to different purposes, as can the appendages attached to the segments. “That you can adapt different segments to different functions has given them the ability to [adapt] to different habitats,” Giribet said. The exhibit also includes live examples to complement the collection specimens. In separate cases crawl a black whip scorpion and five six- to eight-inch-long Sonoran Desert millipedes. Despite their fearsome looks, Giribet said arthropods are misunderstood. Most are harmless, he said, adding that even scorpions aren’t as bad as most people think. “Most arthropods are not harmful. Even scorpions are not that bad,” Giribet said, adding that some can be picked up by hand. “But you’ve got to know which end is which before you do.” Related links:

Fischer, Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, curated the “Cosmic Origins” display which features a lunar rock on display at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Juan Siliezar Harvard Staff Writer Fifty years ago, American astronauts landed on the surface of the moon, inspiring a new wave of scientific research and discovery about the cosmos. Now, the Harvard Museum of Natural History is displaying parts of that history in a new mini-exhibit looking at what scientists have learned about the beginnings and workings of the known universe. “ Cosmic Origins ,” opens Saturday, the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11’s lunar landing, and includes a portion of a moon rock collected during NASA’s Apollo 12 mission. “In the 50 years since we first set foot on the moon, humanity’s understanding of the origins and evolution not only of our planet and solar system, but also of the vast wider universe, has grown astronomically,” said Janis Sacco, director of exhibitions at the Harvard Museums of Science & Culture. “‘Cosmic Origins’ represents a sampling of this growing body of knowledge, assembled with the help of Harvard faculty and researchers in the departments of Earth and Planetary Sciences and Astronomy. “From my perspective, what is most exciting about the science in ‘Cosmic Origins’ is what it reveals about common origins and the nature of all that we know in the universe,” she said. “Everything we can see and touch, the processes that shape worlds, even life itself, all arise from the activities of stars. For me, it is a wondrous thing that we are all connected to the larger cosmos in this way.” A display of a portion of a lunar rock collected from the surface of the moon during the Apollo 12 mission. Along with the moon rock, visitors can touch iron meteorites from the collections of the Harvard Mineralogical and Geological Museum and see a wall-sized mural of the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant 6,500 light years away. A media station explores 3D models of the universe, theories about the creation of moons, the nature of asteroids and meteorites, and famous Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei’s observations of Jupiter’s moons. The presentation is located within the Earth & Planetary Sciences exhibit and is on view through Nov. 27. A special event, “Lunar Soirée,” celebrating the 1969 moon landing takes place the same day as the opening. Admission is $20 for members and $25 for nonmembers. The event is 21-plus. “Cosmic Origins” is on display at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, 26 Oxford St., on the Harvard campus. The museum is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Plan your visit or call 617.495.3045 for admission prices. The mini-exhibit is presented in memory of the late John Huchra, vice provost for research policy at Harvard University and a professor of astronomy at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , through the generosity of Rebecca Henderson, Ph.D. ’88, John and Natty McArthur University Professor at Harvard Business School.
