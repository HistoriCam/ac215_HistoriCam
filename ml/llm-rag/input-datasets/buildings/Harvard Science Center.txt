The Harvard University Science Center is Harvard University 's main classroom and laboratory building for undergraduate science and mathematics, in addition to housing numerous other facilities and services. Located just north of Harvard Yard , the Science Center was built in 1972 and opened in 1973 after a design by Josep Lluís Sert , who was then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design . Harvard had been interested in building an undergraduate science center in the 1950s and 1960s. However, in the midst of an economic decline, funding could not be found. No concrete plans were made until in 1968, Edwin Land , inventor of the Polaroid "Land" camera , made a $12.5 million donation to construct a science center specifically for undergraduates. Opponents of the plan feared that funding would be insufficient to complete the project, and that the building's maintenance costs would be unreasonably high. The Biology Department also protested the move of its undergraduate-instruction facilities far from the department's main quarters. Professor George Wald argued that this would degrade the quality of instruction. There was also dissatisfaction with cancellation of plans at that time for a new biochemistry building. The plan called for demolition of Lawrence Hall, a laboratory and a living space built in 1848. By the time of the scheduled demolition, a commune of students and " street people " calling themselves the "Free University" had taken residence in the unused building. The controversy was rendered moot when fire gutted the building a month later in May 1970. As part of the project, in 1966–68 the portion of Cambridge Street running along the north edge of Harvard Yard was depressed into a 4-lane motor vehicle underpass , thus allowing unhindered pedestrian movement between the Yard and Harvard facilities to the north, including the new Science Center. Architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting wrote that this was the "most important improvement in Cambridge since the construction of [what would later be called] Memorial Drive in the 1890s". Harvard commissioned architects Sert, Jackson and Associates to design and build the facility. Josep Lluis Sert , who had become Dean of the Harvard School of Design in 1953, had designed a number of other Harvard buildings, including Peabody Terrace , Holyoke Center (now the Smith Campus Center ), and the Harvard Divinity School's Center for the Study of World Religions . These buildings were part of a modernist movement that sought to break away from the Georgian and related styles used at Harvard for hundreds of years. Thus, the Science Center is largely steel and concrete, with abundant natural light. Construction lasted from 1970 to 1972. From 2001 to 2004 a $22 million, 32,000-square-foot (3,000 m 2 ) renovation created space for the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments and expanded other facilities. A room-sized historic electromechanical computer built in 1944, the Harvard Mark I , was displayed on the ground floor next to the central stairwell in the main lobby of the building (it has since been moved to the Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston, Massachusetts). The Science Center comprises nine stories, plus a basement and observatory floor. It houses the History of Science, the Mathematics, and the Statistics Departments. Other facilities include: Secreted beneath the Science Center itself and its courtyard (and largely unknown those who work and study at Harvard) is a "gargantuan" chilled water plant, "a magnificent Piranesi -like interior with the volume of Boston's Symphony Hall " providing cooling to many Harvard buildings from the Science Center northward. The building itself was first opened around the time of the 1973 oil crisis , and was plagued with huge energy costs, temperature control problems, and roof leaks for decades. The plaza between the Science Center and Harvard Yard , created by the depression of Cambridge Street and Broadway into a large tunnel, is used at various times for food trucks, roller skating, ice skating, and other activities such as markets and concerts. Tents are erected for special events such as Commencement. The Tanner Fountain, a sculptural installation of large boulders and landscaping, operates during warm weather. 42°22′35″N 71°07′00″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.3764°N 71.1166°W ﻿ / 42.3764; -71.1166

The largest component of the $100 million gift will be allocated to the Science Center (pictured). Kris Snibbe/Harvard file photo Harvard announced today that an alumnus and his wife made a $100 million gift to support the Science Center, enhance mathematics scholarship, and provide unrestricted resources for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). It is the first nine-figure gift made to Harvard since The Harvard Campaign concluded in June, and the largest to date in new President Larry Bacow’s tenure. “This remarkable gift will provide powerful momentum for the sciences at Harvard,” Bacow said. “We are grateful to the donors for sharing our commitment to Harvard’s academic mission and advancing life-changing scholarship. This is a critical investment in ideas that will create exponential value not only for Harvard students and faculty, but also for society as a whole.” The 1990s alumnus of the College made the gift as a tribute to his father, as a show of confidence in Bacow’s presidency, and to commemorate the strategic leadership of Michael D. Smith, the Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 2007‒2018. “My undergraduate experience was an amazing time in my life,” the alumnus said. “I feel so much love for Harvard, my classmates, and my professors, some of whom are still part of my life today. I have truly admired Mike’s thoughtful leadership, and I have great confidence in Larry’s vision. But I especially want to show the love, respect, and admiration I have for my dad, who sacrificed so much to make my education possible.” “This is a critical investment in ideas that will create exponential value not only for Harvard students and faculty, but also for society as a whole.” The largest component of the gift will be allocated to the Science Center, ensuring that this core facility is world-class in its labs, equipment, technology, and renovated spaces. The Science Center is Harvard’s central hub for undergraduate science and mathematics. The donors also made two allocations for Harvard’s mathematics program, one an exchange fund to advance academic collaborations in mathematics and applied mathematics between Harvard and universities in Israel. The designation will provide resources for research, lectures, travel, and other activities by graduate students, postdoctoral students, and faculty. The second fund will support a postdoctoral fellowship in mathematical finance. The unrestricted portion of the gift will provide flexibility for FAS leadership to address pressing needs and to green-light new opportunities that support students, faculty, facilities, and technology. “Having a significant fund of flexible resources gives us critical capacity to sustain our core mission, embrace new innovation, and prepare our students for lives of leadership and service to the world,” said current Edgerley Family Dean Claudine Gay. “This gift will make such a difference in the lives and scholarship of students and faculty for many years to come.” Unrestricted philanthropy has been pivotal in advancing research in big data, brain research, and climate science at Harvard. Flexible funds also have been key in enhancing student life. With these resources, Harvard has been able to attract world-class faculty, offer unparalleled curricula such as the popular first-year seminar program series, and create new research programs such as the Dean’s Competitive Fund for Promising Scholarship, which supports faculty pursuing innovative and high-impact research opportunities.

Title: Mark I, rebooted

Photos by Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Alvin Powell Harvard Staff Writer It is just 1.8 miles from Harvard’s Science Center in Cambridge to the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston. The trip, from the Oxford Street building through Harvard Square and down North Harvard Street, should take about 10 minutes by car — about half an hour if you walk. So taking a year is bad, even considering Boston-area traffic. But there is a legitimate excuse for why it took so long to get the Harvard IBM Mark I Automatic Calculator — a computing milestone described in 1950 by Time magazine as “a progenitrix, a sort of mechanical Eve” — to its new home: the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the world’s first programmable computers, the Mark I — originally the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator — represented a key step forward in the global digital evolution. Before it began operation in 1944, computing machines (some of them faster than the Mark I) each had to be designed to solve a specific problem, The Mark I, however, could use punched cards and punched paper tape to store data and instructions that could address an array of problems. “It was such a first for its time,” said Sara Schechner , the David P. Wheatland Curator of Harvard’s Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments , which counts the machine among its most treasured holdings. “We have lots of very significant items, but it ranks up there as a special thing.” It’s also the collection’s largest item. The original Mark I weighed five tons and was 50 feet long. It was the brainchild of a Harvard graduate student, Howard Aiken, who designed it in 1937, building on decades-old inspiration from British engineer and inventor Charles Babbage. Aiken shopped the idea around until IBM took interest. The machine itself, developed in collaboration with company scientists, was delivered to Harvard’s Cruft Lab in 1944, in time to lend a hand in the nation’s World War II effort, including the development of the atom bomb, missile trajectories, and the design of radar facilities.

Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer The project was run by the U.S. Navy and overseen by a crew headed by Aiken, who had enlisted and served as the project’s commander. Among those who played key roles was Lt. Grace Hopper, a mathematician. Hopper, who would rise to the rank of rear admiral, played a key role as an early Mark I programmer — making her one of the world’s first. She compiled a book on how to program the machine, which became the world’s first such computer manual, Schechner said. Hopper’s notes provide important documentation of those days, whose echoes can be heard today in now-familiar terms used routinely in talking about computers, Schechner said. A repeating “loop” for the Mark I was an actual loop of punched paper instructions that fed into the machine continuously. A software “patch” for the Mark I referred to the paper patches applied over erroneously punched holes on a program tape or card. Once patched, it could be repunched with the correct instruction. The Mark I’s “library” was where all the punched paper tapes and cards that held the Mark I’s programming instructions were stored. And, though the term “bug” was already in use for hard-to-find mechanical problems, the Mark I saw it applied to computers, Schechner said. Hopper’s notebook contains a tongue-in-cheek reference to the term, an actual moth that was the cause of a malfunction in the next generation machine, the Mark II. Hopper taped the dead insect to the page, noting that the mythical “bug” had been observed at last. With a computation speed of 3 hertz — today machines run at a relative breakneck pace of billions of hertz — the electro-mechanical Mark I was driven by a physical driveshaft connected to its clattering mechanical relays and was actually slower (in some cases a lot slower) than other computing machines of its time, some of which used less reliable but faster vacuum tubes. But the Mark I was built using proven, off-the-shelf business components from IBM wherever possible and was more accurate and reliable. Those qualities were valued, and the machine would continue to churn out answers until 1959 despite the development of newer, faster versions, including the Mark II, III, and IV, also developed by Aiken at Harvard. After its retirement, the machine was dismantled, with roughly half remaining at Harvard and two other pieces going to IBM and the Smithsonian Institution. The machine’s new home, the Science and Engineering Complex, will house labs and classrooms for the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), where Harvard’s computer science programs reside. The long-anticipated move of offices and labs for about half the School’s faculty into the new building was about to shift into high gear when the pandemic struck, putting on hold both the move and finishing work on the building. The move-in resumed last fall and School officials expect the SEC to be fully operational in September when students return to campus. The Mark I relocation was planned and carried out by teams from the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments and SEAS, led by SEAS Assistant Dean for Campus Planning Pamela Choi Redfern and organized by the project’s senior manager, Michael Noll, Schechner said. “There’s a kind of beauty to it. There’s so much wiring and soldering, so many connections bundled and almost knit.” “It is gratifying to have this groundbreaking machine that links back to the dawn of the computer age ensconced in the new home of Harvard’s burgeoning computer science programs,” said SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III. “Surrounded by cutting-edge research — from artificial intelligence and machine learning to quantum devices and networks — the Mark I will be on public display to educate and inspire future generations of engineers and scientists.” Even at half its original size, Schechner said the Mark I is not only the largest item in the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, it is also the largest thing whose move she’d ever overseen. The Mark I had been in Harvard’s Science Center since the 1990s, when its home in what was then the Aiken Computation Laboratory was demolished to make room for the Maxwell-Dworkin Lab. In preparation for the current operation, Schechner said they examined photographs of that earlier move, seeking clues about the best way to dismantle and transport the massive machine. The move to Allston and the SEC had been long planned — Schechner said she spoke to architects during the SEC’s design phase about the need to accommodate the Mark I’s considerable weight in its new home in the building’s atrium. A more leisurely dismantling and reassembly had been planned for the summer of 2020, with more time for cleaning and documentation, but COVID intervened. This time, the desire to get the new exhibit in place and the building ready for students led to a compressed, two-week timeframe for the move, which was completed in early July. To achieve the chore, the Harvard team brought in five professional riggers to augment the collection’s staff. The machine was carefully dismantled in stages and packed for the truck ride to the SEC. Schechner said she hovered over the dismantling “like a nervous parent,” photographing and documenting the operation. “There’s a kind of beauty to it. There’s so much wiring and soldering, so many connections bundled and almost knit.”

Title: Early museum re-created in Science Center installation
Date: November 4, 2004

Body:
The Danish professor of medicine Ole Worm (1588-1654) believed, as did his more enlightened contemporaries, that learning comes about through the observation of nature – “through empiricism and experiment” – and not just through the study of texts. Worm firmly believed that vision was the most trustworthy sense for natural history investigations. And that is why he assembled a museum in his Copenhagen home. Filled with ethnographic curiosities, skulls, stuffed animals, and the latest in optical and experimental devices, the early museum was as beautiful in its way as it was informative. We know what the museum looked like from the detailed frontispiece in the 1655 catalog called “Worm’s Museum, or the History of Very Rare Things, Natural and Artificial, Domestic and Exotic, Which Are Stored in the Author’s House in Copenhagen.” ‘Bringing Nature Inside: 17th Century Natural History, Classification, and Vision,’ Special Exhibition Gallery, Science Center, room 251, 1 Oxford St., Cambridge. Now through Jan. 14, 2005. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., second and third Sundays of November and December, 1-5 p.m. Now, Rosamond Purcell has fashioned a meticulous re-creation of this 17th century world-within-a-world with “Bringing Nature Inside,” which can be seen at the Special Exhibits Gallery at the Science Center, room 251. (The re-creation of Olaus Worm’s collection was originally part the exhibition “Rosamond Purcell: Two Rooms,” organized by the Santa Monica Museum of Art and curator Lisa Melandri.) To conjure up the private museum of the Danish professor of medicine, Purcell used ethnographic objects and natural history specimens borrowed from collections at Harvard and elsewhere in the United States. In re-creating Worm’s world, Purcell, an installation artist, and Sara Schechner, the David P. Wheatland Curator of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, explore not only the place of Worm’s cabinet among other early museums and the ways he organized his collection, but also the issues that arose in representing nature through the sense of sight. “Bringing Nature Inside: 17th Century Natural History, Classification, and Vision” is on view through January.
