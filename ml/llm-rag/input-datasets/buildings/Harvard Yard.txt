Harvard Yard is the oldest and among the most prominent parts of the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts . The yard has a historic center and modern crossroads and contains most of the freshman dormitories , Harvard's most important libraries, Memorial Church , several classroom and departmental buildings, and the offices of senior university officials, including the president of Harvard University . The Yard grew over the centuries around Harvard College's first parcel of land, purchased in 1637. Today it is a grassy area of 22.4 acres (9.1 ha) bounded principally by Massachusetts Avenue , Cambridge Street, Broadway, and Quincy Street. Its perimeter fencing – principally iron, with some stretches of brick – has twenty-seven gates . The center of the Yard, known as Tercentenary Theatre , is a wide grassy area bounded by Widener Library , Memorial Church , University Hall , and Sever Hall . Tercentenary Theatre is the site of annual commencement exercises and other convocations . The western third of Harvard Yard, which opens onto Peabody Street (often mistaken for nearby Massachusetts Avenue) at Johnston Gate and abuts the center of Harvard Square to the south, is known as the Old Yard. Most of the freshman dormitories cluster around the Old Yard, including Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building and the second-oldest academic building in the United States. Massachusetts Hall also houses the offices of the President of Harvard University. The original Harvard Hall in the Old Yard housed the college library, including the books donated by John Harvatd ,all but one of which were destroyed when the building burned in 1764. Rebuilt in 1766, the current Harvard Hall now houses classrooms. Across the Old Yard from Johnston Gate is University Hall (1815), whose white-granite facade was the first to challenge the red-brick Georgian style until then ascendant; between its twin west staircases stands the John Harvard statue . University Hall contains major administrative offices, including those of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Dean of Harvard College . Libraries in the Yard are Widener Library , its connected Pusey Library annex, Houghton Library for rare books and manuscripts, and Lamont Library , the main undergraduate library. Classroom and departmental buildings include Emerson Hall, Sever Hall , Robinson Hall, and Boylston Hall. The Harvard Bixi , a Chinese stele with inscribed text, is located near Widener. The freshman dormitories of Harvard Yard include the upper levels of Massachusetts Hall , and Wigglesworth Hall , Weld Hall , Grays Hall , Matthews Hall , Straus Hall , Mower Hall , Hollis Hall , Stoughton Hall , Lionel Hall , Holworthy Hall , Canaday Hall , and Thayer Hall . Nestled among Mower, Hollis, Lionel, and Stoughton Halls is Holden Chapel , home of the Holden Choirs . Nearby is Phillips Brooks House, dedicated to student service to the community . Administrative buildings in the Yard include the aforementioned University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; Loeb House, on the east side of the Yard; and Wadsworth House, on the south side. Loeb House is the home of Harvard's governing bodies: the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers . Wadsworth House houses the Harvard University Librarian and the Office of the University Marshal , among others. Lehman Hall , at the southwestern corner of the Yard, provides administrative services for students who live off-campus. 42°22′28″N 71°07′02″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.37447°N 71.11719°W ﻿ / 42.37447; -71.11719

Silvia Mazzocchin The 25 gates in Harvard Yard manage a rare feat: They are pragmatic and artistic at the same time. When locked, the gates provide security and intimacy. But then there is the beauty: a bold H nestled into the iron; metal leaves entangled in iron flowers; black highlighted with gold; long-ago dates molded into bars. Sinuous vines and ivies often cling to the gates, moving with the wind. The dates in each gate reflect their history, as recounted by Blair Kamin N.F. ’13 in his recent book “Gates of Harvard Yard” (Princeton Architectural Press). In 1889, Samuel Johnston gave the funds to build the first gate to open into the Yard, but members of other classes soon followed his example to build the entryways, many of them illustrated here, that now preserve their memory.

Image captions:
- Bradstreet Gate, North, honors the presence of women on campus. It was dedicated to Anne Dudley Bradstreet, the first published poet of the American colonies, in 1997, the 25th anniversary of women living in the Yard’s dormitories. The picture shows a detail on one of the wrought-iron side columns.
- The Class of 1875 Gate, Southwest, faces the hustle and bustle of Harvard Square. It welcomes passersby to find relief in the Yard’s quiet atmosphere.
- The Class of 1889 Gate, South, is crowned by the arched tunnel that crosses Wigglesworth Hall. This gate was planned as a twin to the Dexter Gate, but the latter’s slight differences gave it more fame.
- McKean Gate (Porcellian Club), South, takes its nickname from one of Harvard’s oldest final clubs. The club won its name when Joseph McKean brought a roast pig to a meeting.
- Dexter Gate (Class of 1890), South. Reflected in the windows of the Harvard Book Store, Dexter Gate is widely known for the inscription on its crest: “Enter to grow in wisdom.” On the reverse side, another inscription reads “Depart to Serve Better Thy Country and Thy Kind.”
- The Class of 1887 Gate, North. The 87 of the wrought-iron gate frames students walking by Annenberg Hall.
- Morgan Gate (Class of 1877), South. Architects McKim, Mead & White planned this gate to serve as a portal at the end of a grand axis connecting the Yard to the Charles River. The project was never developed, and the majestic gate now serves as an entrance to Widener Library.
- The Class of 1888 Gate, North. Framing the rose windows on Memorial Hall, this gate stands next to the Class of 1887 gate. Together, they comprise the only double gate of the Yard.
- Fire Station Gate, North. Partly covered by rust, the gate’s details testify to its main use as a service entrance for fire trucks and garbage collection. The Fire Station at 491 Broadway stands across it.
- Bacon Gate (Class of 1880), South. Vines cling to the limestone of Bacon Gate, giving it a mysterious, decadent aspect. This gate conceals one of Harvard’s hidden secrets: the beauty of Dudley Garden, accessible from inside the Yard.
- Johnston Gate, Northwest. Silhouetted against the sky, the gate’s elegant decorations create the illusion of brushes of black tempera. The oldest gate in the Yard, Johnston serves as the main entrance, and leads directly to the John Harvard Statue. The wrought-iron gate was erected in 1889 when alumnus Samuel Johnston donated funds to replace the wooden fence that had stood on the spot.
- The Class of 1874 Gate, Northwest, casts a shadow on the brick wall of Lionel Hall. The ironwork masterfully joins C- and S-shaped scrollwork.
- The Class of 1870 Gate, Northwest. The gate’s ornaments embrace the design of the back door of Holden Hall. The gate, always locked, keeps preserved and inaccessible the beauty of the “secret garden” behind the hall.
- North Gates fence. Sunset turns the wrought iron into gold.
- The Class of 1881 Gate, North. In front of Phillips Brooks House, the portal invites students to “come within its gates, in order that in whole-hearted service to the truth, they may enter into life and so be free.”
- The Class of 1885 Gate, East, frames the entrance to the Harvard Art Museums on Quincy Street. Its original name is now almost forgotten, and it is widely referred to as “Sever Gate.”
- The Class of 1889 Gate, South. Locked for the night, lights shine in the arched tunnel that crosses Wigglesworth.
- Loeb House Gate, East, opens onto the path to the residence and site that for many years housed Harvard presidents. Today, it is the home of Harvard’s Governing Boards and their administrative offices.

Title: A luminous vision for Harvard Yard

From the steps of Widener Library, a woman photographs “Autumn (… Nothing Personal),” a public sculpture by artist Teresita Fernández recently installed in Harvard Yard at Tercentenary Theatre. Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer On a recent afternoon, the artist Teresita Fernández sat in the center of her latest creation, admiring the view. The sun dipped, sending rays through the thousands of orange-and-yellow-pinstriped tubes that form her Tercentenary Theatre installation, “Autumn (… Nothing Personal).” Soon the work was glowing. As passersby slipped in and out of the frame, Fernández remarked on the work’s cinematic effect, in which “anything moving appears and disappears … as if each one of these tubes is almost like a shutter that opens and closes.” When a breeze rustled the 10-foot-high tubes, which rise from plywood benches arranged in concentric circles, the sound reminded her of “a bamboo forest.” “This piece behaves in a certain way,” said Fernández of the installation, which was commissioned by the Harvard University Committee on the Arts (HUCA) and inspired by the change of seasons, the site’s storied history and imposing facades, and the 1964 James Baldwin essay “Nothing Personal.” “It’s constantly changing,” the artist added. Both change and light manifest as visible presences and invisible inspirations in “Autumn (… Nothing Personal),” installed between Memorial Church and Widener Library and on view through Oct. 1. During the day the piece reacts to the shifting sunlight, the shadows cast by the canopy of elms and the colors of the season. Embedded lights lend the work an entirely “different tone in its nocturnal hours.” Organizers hope planned performances and discussions in the space, many focused around Baldwin’s work, will further animate the installation. Fernández’s entry point for the piece was Baldwin’s essay, a biting commentary on the violence he observed and experienced as an African-American living through the Civil Rights era. But Baldwin’s writing, she points out, also embraced change, and hope. Natalie Haddad and Billy Hilsee work to construct the installation over the weekend before its opening. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer “For nothing is fixed, forever and forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock,” Baldwin wrote in his essay, which appeared just months after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. “Generations do not cease to be born,” the essay continues, “and we are responsible to them because we are the only witnesses they have.” If Fernández, a 2005 MacArthur Fellow, draws inspiration from the natural world, her work is also layered with deep social meaning. In a series of drawings titled “Small American Fires,” currently on view at the Harvard Art Museums, flaming landscapes refer both to “slash-and-burn techniques and the way that indigenous people have transformed the land and the landscape for millennia” and “contemporary American violence,” Fernández said. Bringing artists into dialogue with the Harvard community has long been a goal of University administrators. Since the release of an Arts Task Force report in 2008 , HUCA has invited artists to campus “for a sustained engagement that can really transform people’s perceptions of the institution and the campus itself,” said Robin Kelsey, arts and humanities dean and co-chair of HUCA. Natalie Haddad hammers the bases as night falls. Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer “Harvard Yard is a sacred space with tremendous historical resonance,” Kelsey said, but often that resonance “has been beset with forms of exclusion and discrimination. “We are living through a moment of reckoning … and Teresita’s installation is perfectly timed to help us with this reckoning, to help us think through issues of inclusion and belonging. Her work encourages, enables, prods us to contend with the troubled dimensions of our history and does so through the beautiful.” Conversations with faculty, students, and staff over the past two years helped inform Fernández’s Harvard installation. In 2017, she led the January arts-intensive session “Imagination, Narrative, Democracy: Public Art in Practice.” Earlier this year she hosted a series of student workshops that developed programming for the space. “The thing that I really took away from all of that is that I was not just making the physical structure,” said Fernández, “I was also creating a kind of underlying social structure and really kind of building an entire context for the work to exist within.” Fernández and Harvard organizers are hoping to “generate community” through a series of programs linked to the installation, including readings and discussions of Baldwin’s work, musical performances, and a talk by Fernández at the Harvard Art Museums. “I think it’s important for Teresita and for those of us who invited her to come to Harvard that this work offers somethings for everyone” said Kelsey. “To fulfill that promise requires activating the work in many different ways.” In addition to creating community, Fernández hopes the programs will help foster something else she strives for in her artwork: intimacy. “That sense of intimacy is what I am hoping will be created, not just by the kind of changing light and the physical structure,” she said, “but by the kinds of things that will happen here. “What I hope is that the kind of space that this creates, with people reading the essay out loud and with performances, speaks to some of the same issues that Baldwin is addressing and that that happens in this exposed way. I keep thinking of it as an exposed reading where each individual is very exposed, rather than a private reading which is in the comfort of your own mind.” On move-in day, Denise Welsh, the proud mother of a first-year from West Boylston, Mass., kicked off her sandals and stretched out on one of the installation’s plywood benches. Later, she relaxed with a few yoga poses on the grass. “I am glad the artist picked this spot,” said Welsh, eyeing the leaves and impressive trunk of a nearby elm. “It’s going to be beautiful with the fall colors. “I like to say some people just have a vision,” she continued. “[Fernández] had a beautiful vision.” The installation will be the setting for “Bliss. This Autumn. Lecturance,” a performance of poetry and music, at 7 p.m. Wednesday. Fernández will give a talk at the Harvard Art Museums at 6 p.m. on Sept. 20. This installation was made possible by the support of the Johnson-Kulukundis Family President’s Fund to enhance the arts at Harvard from Maryellie Kulukundis Johnson ’57 and Rupert H. Johnson Jr.

Title: In the Yard, a changing of the guard

Editor – Georgia Bellas | Photography – Stephanie Mitchell / Harvard Staff Photographer | Interview – Alvin Powell / Harvard Staff Writer Alvin Powell Harvard Staff Writer For those with an eye to nature, Harvard Yard is home to much more than freshmen. There are living fossils and dying icons. There are locusts and larch, hackberry and holly, Kentucky coffee and catalpas. There are colors in autumn, rebirth in the spring, and shade in the summer. Even amid winter’s winds, rough bark reminds us of the life asleep inside as we scurry past. The trees of Harvard Yard have for centuries shielded student travels. They’ve roofed the Yard and framed its iconic image. All one has to do is imagine the Yard barren and treeless to understand that trees are as much a part of that landscape as its historic buildings and John Harvard’s brass toe. And, like much of the University in this globalized age, the trees of the Yard are changing. The Yard is approaching the end of an era, when elms — once thought the perfect trees for civic plantings because of their vaselike shape — graced and dominated the Yard. The sad story of America’s elms is well known. Loved for their high-branching pattern that creates a shady canopy above and a parklike setting below, the tree was planted everywhere, making fertile ground for Dutch elm disease when it arrived in the 1920s. In the disease’s wake, the Yard has undergone a quiet renovation over the past several decades. As elms have died, they’ve been replaced with other trees that will retain the Yard’s parklike setting. In the old Yard, large oaks stand side by side with the elms. In Tercentenary Theatre, where Commencement and other ceremonial events occur, large honey locust trees mix with maples and elms to provide a ceiling for campus affairs. There are still elms left, but hundreds have given way to tens. Harvard groundskeepers fight the good fight, deploying fertilizer, fungicide, and careful pruning, but the Yard’s remaining elms are locked in a battle that will likely claim even the strongest of them. “They’re survivors, but as survivors, they show their wear,” said Donald H. Pfister, the Asa Gray Professor of Systematic Botany. “They’re trimmed very severely. They’re pampered. Fungicides are used to treat them. Each year, there are fewer elms in the Yard.” The result is a Yard that today looks a lot more like the forests surrounding it. American species have dominated the replanting, Pfister said, which has proceeded with an eye toward diversity in creating a mixed stand resistant to pests and diseases, and toward uniformity in retaining the Yard’s historic look. “There’s a collective [reaction of visitors], that is, ‘Of course this is what it’s supposed to look like. You’re supposed to be able to see students walking through. You’re supposed to be able to look across from Johnson Gate to see John Harvard,’ ” Pfister said. “Those are characteristics of the Yard and how the Yard has been illustrated in its iconic past.” Though planting native American trees has been emphasized as the Yard is remade, not all the plantings are native. In the small area between Robinson Hall and the Memorial Church is a stand of dawn redwoods , which Pfister called “living fossils.” The trees, conifers that lose their needles in the fall and whose brown trunks look almost muscled, were first known from fossils and were thought extinct until living specimens were found in China in the 1940s. Harvard played a role in the tree’s resurgence. Seeds were collected and cultivated at the Arnold Arboretum . Specimens today have been planted around the world. The Yard’s trees change on a smaller, more expected scale as well. In his travels across the Yard, Pfister marks the seasons by the changes he sees, whether leaves are budding out and flowers blooming, whether fruits are growing or falling on the ground. He even gets a kick out of the walnuts’ ongoing battle with the automobile, acted out each fall as trees overhanging Quincy Street bombard the cars parked below. “The Yard is ever-changing,” Pfister said. “One sees different things, depending on the season.” For Pfister, the Yard’s trees are as much a part of Harvard as its buildings and people. They frame the activities of students and faculty, and perhaps should join the Yard’s ghosts in their “long winding train reaching back into eternity,” spoken of by writer Ralph Waldo Emerson in his verse inscribed near Meyer Gate. “You can think about the Yard that way too … the trees under which people played,” Pfister said. “The activities of the College take place under them, Commencement takes place under them. [Students] leave, we [faculty] stay for a while. The trees are here for much longer.”
