An accomplished businessman and former Harvard Overseer, C.D. “Dick” Spangler, M.B.A. ’56, died on Sunday. Jon Chase/Harvard file photo HBS Communications Harvard Business School alumnus and former member of the Board of Overseers C.D. (“Dick”) Spangler Jr., M.B.A. ’56, died July 22 at his home in Charlotte, N.C. He was 86 years old. Extraordinarily accomplished in both the private and public sectors, after graduating from Harvard Business School (HBS) Spangler served two years in the U.S. Army. He went on to achieve great success in several industries, including his family’s construction business and banking, chairing the Bank of North Carolina during the 1980s and playing a key role in its merger with the North Carolina National Bank Corp., now Bank of America. Spangler took great pride in recounting that while he was an M.B.A. student, his father was in the School’s Advanced Management Program. From 1998 to 2004, Spangler was a member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers and served as its president from 2003 to 2004. His devotion, generosity, and service to Harvard University and HBS were truly extraordinary. With his wife, Meredith Riggs Spangler, and two daughters, Anna Spangler Nelson, M.B.A. ’88, and Abigail Riggs Spangler, he gave a major gift to the School that made the Spangler Center possible . An HBS professorship, held by William C. Kirby, also bears the family’s name: the Spangler Family Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. “Throughout his life and career, Dick Spangler epitomized the mission of Harvard Business School, making a difference in the world and in the lives of so many others — a kind and true gentleman whom we will always remember and admire and greatly miss,” said HBS Dean Nitin Nohria. “We were blessed to have him as our dear friend and benefactor for so many years and must continue to live up to the high standards he always expected of us. He will always hold a place of honor in the history of Harvard Business School and in the hearts of all of us who were fortunate enough to know him.” Always willing to offer his advice and counsel, Spangler served on HBS’s Board of Dean’s Advisors from 1991 to 2011 and as an emeritus member in more recent years. He was a member of the HBS Visiting Committee and its chair from 2001 to 2003. Spangler was co-chair of his 30th HBS reunion gift committee, and from 2002 to 2005 he chaired HBS’ previous Capital Campaign, an effort that raised some $600 million. In 1988, Spangler received HBS’s highest accolade, the Alumni Achievement Award. In 2005, the University honored him with the Harvard Medal, a special honor for alumni in appreciation of their many contributions to Harvard. He was the recipient of an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University in 2013. “Dick Spangler was an extraordinary leader who made a difference in multiple worlds,” added Kirby, Spangler Family Professor at Harvard Business School and T.M. Chang Professor of China Studies at Harvard University. “Successful in business, he became a major figure in American higher education. A proud Tar Heel devoted to his undergraduate alma mater, he was an exceptional president of the University of North Carolina. A loyal and generous alumnus of Harvard Business School, he had a transformative impact on our School and campus. “Dick was a man full of energy, optimism, and imagination. I came to know and admire him when I was dean of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and he was president of our Board of Overseers at a time that demanded real leadership in Harvard’s governing boards,” said Kirby. “We shared a common passion for China, among other things, and I had the great pleasure of traveling with him and Meredith on two memorable trips across China and Tibet. A more intrepid explorer I have never met, and we exchanged books and essays on China from that time on. After I joined the HBS faculty in 2008, I have been privileged to be the Spangler Family Professor of Business Administration. I can think of no greater honor.” With a lifelong passion for education, Spangler also oversaw the schooling of more than a million students as chair of North Carolina ’s Board of Education from 1982 to 1986. As president of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, from 1986 to 1997, he increased enrollment and faculty funding while prioritizing educational quality and affordability. In addition to his wife and daughters, he is survived by a son-in-law, Thomas C. Nelson, M.B.A. ’88, and four grandchildren. In his honor and memory, the flags on HBS’s campus have been lowered to half-staff. For more information , visit the HBS website. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday at 11 a.m. at the Myers Park Baptist Church, 1900 Queens Road, in Charlotte, N.C.

Title: A guide to Harvard’s toasty fireplaces

Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Juan Siliezar Harvard Staff Writer When the weather outside turns frightful a fire is so delightful. So with the start of winter just a couple of weeks away we’ve assembled a guide to campus hot spots where you can get out of the cold. While most of these fireplaces are gas or electric — the majority of Harvard’s public wood-burners were sealed long ago for safety reasons — they still do a pretty good job of warming the spirit. Above, one of five gas hearths in Smith Campus Center. Top image: the fireside lounge at the Law School’s Harkness Commons. Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Located in the heart of campus, the Smith Center features five gas hearths, said Julie Crites, the director of Common Spaces. Two, on the upper floor of the Harvard Commons, are open to the public. Each is sleek, modern, and surrounded by plenty of chairs and couches. Another can be found in the Collaborative Commons and two more are on the 10th floor’s Riverview Commons, but access to these require a Harvard ID. The fireplaces will be lit daily from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. If curling up with a book before a fire sounds inviting, head to the first floor of Gutman Library. There are three fireplaces nestled inside, which turn on automatically when the temperature outside dips below 48 degrees during open hours (typically 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.). “The fire is fueled by gas and arranged with synthetic logs to provide the aesthetic of a real wood-burning fire,” said Jason L. Carlson, chief of operations at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Behind glass for safety reasons, two of the fireplaces sit right in the main lobby. The third sits in a nook behind the cafe. Harvard Law School has three fireplaces, all of them in the Wasserstein Hall Caspersen Student Center. Two are on each end of the Robert B. and Candice J. Haas Lounge, and one is on the terrace level of Harkness Commons in what is fittingly referred to as the fireside lounge. The fires typically run during open hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) in the fall and spring, and often attract visitors from across campus. For instance, when asked what brought him to Harkness from the School of Engineering, Ph.D. student Colby Banbury didn’t hesitate to say “the fireplace.” “It’s a cozy environment to work in when it’s snowing,” he said, adding that coming by has become a habit that he’s likely to continue through the cold months. Across the Charles River, Harvard Business School has four fireplaces in the first-floor lounge area of the Spangler Center. They are conveniently located near the building’s coffee bar, so visitors can grab a hot beverage and bring it over to sit and enjoy the fire. A fifth fireplace is in Spangler Grille’s lower level. They are typically on 2 to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday. In total, HBS has 38 fireplaces but only these five are active. Like at HBS, there are a number of fireplaces across the Harvard Medical School campus but only one works, said Sean Allen, facilities operations manager at Harvard Medical School. That one is found across from the atrium in the Tosteson Medical Education Center. This electric hearth is surrounded by modern furniture in a living-room setting, along with study carrels, group study rooms, and windows overlooking the Seeley G. Mudd courtyard. The fire is “always on,” Allen said, “though [with] very low energy usage.” WinterFest is coming. Harvard’s Common Spaces’ annual event gives visitors a reason to spend some time outside and get toasty next to a handful of blazing fire pits. WinterFest will run from Jan. 27 through March 13, and the fire pits will be lit on select days. If the fire isn’t enough to pull you in, hot chocolate and marshmallows are usually available, too. Almost all of the Houses and deans’ residences have fireplaces, but most are now just ornamental, like the ones in Quincy House or Eliot House. Fireplaces that do see some use are generally not in areas open to the general public but limited to College students, House staff, and their guests. These are mainly in deans’ residences, historic spaces like the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Suite in Adams House, or new gas units like the one in the Dunster dining hall. “Now that the weather has turned we have been lighting it for community night dinners on Thursdays and for various other special occasions as well,” said Sean D. Kelly, faculty dean of Dunster House and the Theresa G. and Ferdinand F. Martignetti Professor of Philosophy. The House, he said, also has outdoor firepits. “There’s nothing like a fire to bring people together.”
