The Harvard Art Museums are part of Harvard University and comprise three museums: the Fogg Museum (established in 1895), the Busch-Reisinger Museum (established in 1903), and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum (established in 1985), and four research centers: the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis (founded in 1958), the Center for the Technical Study of Modern Art (founded in 2002), the Harvard Art Museums Archives , and the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies (founded in 1928). The three museums that constitute the Harvard Art Museums were initially integrated into a single institution under the name Harvard University Art Museums in 1983. The word "University" was dropped from the institutional name in 2008. The collections include approximately 250,000 objects in all media, ranging in date from antiquity to the present and originating in Europe, North America, North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The main building contains 204,000 square feet (19,000 m 2 ) of space for public exhibitions, classrooms, conservation and research labs, and other related functions. Approximately 43,000 square feet (4,000 m 2 ) of space are dedicated to exhibitions. In 2008, the Harvard Art Museums' historic building at 32 Quincy Street, Cambridge, was closed for a major renovation and expansion project. During the beginning phases of this project, the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at 485 Broadway, Cambridge, displayed selected works from the collections of the Fogg, Busch-Reisinger, and Sackler museums from September 13, 2008, through June 1, 2013. The renovated building at 32 Quincy Street united the three museums in a single facility designed by architect Renzo Piano , which increased gallery space by 40% and added a glass, truncated pyramidal roof. In a street-level view of the front facade, the glass roof and other expansions are mostly hidden, largely preserving the original appearance of the building. The renovation was supervised by LeMessurier Consultants [ citation needed ] and Silman Associates. The renovation added six levels of galleries, classrooms, lecture halls, and new study areas providing access to parts of the 250,000-piece collection of the museums. The new building was opened in November 2014. The Fogg Museum, opened to the public in 1896, is the oldest and largest component of the Harvard Art Museums. The museum was originally housed in an Italian Renaissance -style building designed by Richard Morris Hunt . According to Donald Preziosi , the museum was not initially established as a gallery for the display of original works of art, but was founded as an institution for the teaching and study of visual arts , and the original building contained classrooms equipped with magic lanterns , a library, an archive of slides and photographs of art works, and exhibition space for reproductions of works of art. In 1925, the building was replaced by a Georgian Revival -style structure on Quincy Street, designed by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch, and Abbott . (The original Hunt Hall remained, underutilized until it was demolished in 1974 to make way for new freshman dormitories. ) The Fogg Museum is renowned for its holdings of Western paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, photographs, prints, and drawings from the Middle Ages to the present. Particular strengths include Italian Renaissance , British Pre-Raphaelite , and French art of the 19th century , as well as 19th- and 20th-century American paintings and drawings. The museum's Maurice Wertheim Collection is a notable group of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works that contains many famous masterpieces, including paintings and sculptures by Paul Cézanne , Edgar Degas , Édouard Manet , Henri Matisse , Pablo Picasso , and Vincent van Gogh . Central to the Fogg's holdings is the Grenville L. Winthrop Collection, with more than 4,000 works of art. Bequeathed to Harvard in 1943, the collection continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the legacy of the Harvard Art Museums, serving as a foundation for teaching, research, and professional training programs. It includes important 19th-century paintings, sculpture, and drawings by William Blake , Edward Burne-Jones , Jacques-Louis David , Honoré Daumier , Winslow Homer , Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres , Alfred Barye , Pierre-Auguste Renoir , Auguste Rodin , John Singer Sargent , Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec , and James Abbott McNeill Whistler . The art museum has Late Medieval Italian paintings by the Master of Offida , Master of Camerino, Bernardo Daddi , Simone Martini , Luca di Tomme , Pietro Lorenzetti , Ambrogio Lorenzetti , Master of Orcanesque Misercordia, Master of Saints Cosmas and Damiançand Bartolomeo Bulgarini. Flemish Renaissance paintings — Master of Catholic Kings, Jan Provoost , Master of Holy Blood, Aelbert Bouts , and Master of Saint Ursula. Italian Renaissance period paintings — Fra Angelico , Sandro Botticelli , Domenico Ghirlandaio , Gherardo Starnina , Cosme Tura , Giovanni di Paolo , and Lorenzo Lotto . French Baroque period paintings — Nicolas Poussin , Jacques Stella , Nicolas Regnier , and Philippe de Champaigne . Dutch Master paintings — Rembrandt , Emanuel de Witte , Jan Steen , Willem Van de Velde , Jacob van Ruisdael , Salomon van Ruysdael , Jan van der Heyden , and Dirck Hals . American paintings — Gilbert Stuart , Charles Willson Peale , Robert Feke , Sanford Gifford , James McNeill Whistler , John Singer Sargent , Thomas Eakins , Man Ray , Ben Shahn , Jacob Lawrence , Lewis Rubenstein [ d ] , Robert Smullyan Sloan [ d ] , Phillip Guston , Jackson Pollock , Kerry James Marshall , and Clyfford Still . In the fall of 2021, the Harvard Art Museums launched the "ReFrame" initiative, with the goal of promoting greater representation and presenting more perspectives within their exhibits. The initiative aims to bring unseen artwork out of storage and re-contextualize existing exhibits, to tell the stories of marginalized individuals in each curation. Founded in 1903 as the Germanic Museum, the Busch–Reisinger Museum was renamed in 1920 when it was moved to Adolphus Busch Hall , named after the brewer and philanthropist Adolphus Busch , former president of the Anheuser-Busch company . The museum's name also commemorates Busch's son-in-law Hugo Reisinger, a German-born American art collector and merchant. The Busch-Reisinger is the only museum in North America dedicated to the study of art from the German-speaking countries of Central and Northern Europe in all media and in all periods. William James spoke at its dedication. Its holdings include significant works of Austrian Secession art, German expressionism , and 1920s abstraction. The museum holds one of the first and largest collections of artifacts related to the Bauhaus design school (1919–1933), which fostered many developments in modernist design. Other strengths include late medieval sculpture and 18th-century art. The museum also holds noteworthy postwar and contemporary art from German-speaking Europe, including works by Georg Baselitz , Anselm Kiefer , Gerhard Richter , and one of the world's most comprehensive collections of works by Joseph Beuys . The Busch–Reisinger Art Museum has oil paintings by artists Lovis Corinth , Max Liebermann , Gustav Klimt , Edvard Munch , Paula Modersohn-Becker , Max Ernst , Ernst Ludwig Kirchner , Franz Marc , Karl Schmidt-Rottluff , Emil Nolde , Erich Heckel , Heinrich Hoerle , Georg Baselitz , László Moholy-Nagy , and Max Beckmann . It has sculpture by Alfred Barye , Käthe Kollwitz , George Minne , and Ernst Barlach . From 1921 to 1991, the Busch–Reisinger was located in Adolphus Busch Hall at 29 Kirkland Street. The Hall continues to house the Busch–Reisinger's founding collection of medieval plaster casts and an exhibition on the history of the Busch–Reisinger Museum; it also hosts concerts on its Flentrop pipe organ. In 1991, the Busch–Reisinger moved to the new Werner Otto Hall, designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates , at 32 Quincy Street. In 2018, Busch–Reisinger featured the exhibition Inventur–Art in Germany, 1943–55 , which was named after a 1945 poem by Günter Eich . In 2019, The Bauhaus and Harvard celebrated the centennial of the founding of the influential design school in Germany. Following its closure by the Nazis in 1933, a number of its former students and faculty made their way to Harvard, where they continued and expanded their work. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum opened in 1985, and was located at 485 Broadway, directly across the street from the original Fogg Museum building. The Sackler building, designed by British architect James Stirling , was named for its major donor Arthur M. Sackler , who was a psychiatrist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Upon its opening in 1984, the building also housed new offices for the History of Art and Architecture faculty, as well as the Digital Images and Slides Collection of the Fine Arts Library. The Sackler building continues to house the History of Art and Architecture Department and the Media Slide Library. Since at least 2018, critics and protestors have called for Harvard to remove the "Sackler" family name from the building and the museum, citing its connection to the aggressive marketing of the addictive drug OxyContin . Defenders have pointed out that Arthur M. Sackler died in 1987, before the development of the opioid problems of the 21st century. This argument is rebutted by activists, who charge that Arthur Sackler promoted Valium and set up an unethical system of marketing drugs that continued after his death. On April 20, 2023, at least 50 protesters associated with the advocacy group P.A.I.N. staged a " die-in " in the atrium of the Harvard Art Museum, promoting continuing efforts to dename Sackler facilities at Harvard. A Harvard spokesman confirmed that Harvard has been "considering" a proposal to remove the Sackler name since October 2022. The museum collection holds important collections of Asian art, most notably, archaic Chinese jades (the widest collection outside of China) and Japanese surimono , as well as outstanding Chinese bronzes, ceremonial weapons, Buddhist cave-temple sculptures, ceramics from China and Korea, Japanese works on paper, and lacquer boxes. The ancient Mediterranean and Byzantine collections comprise significant works in all media from Greece, Rome, Egypt, and the Near East. Strengths include Greek vases, small bronzes, and coins from throughout the ancient Mediterranean world. The museum also holds works on paper from Islamic lands and India, including paintings, drawings, calligraphy, and manuscript illustrations, with particular strength in Rajput art, as well as important Islamic ceramics from the 8th through to the 19th century. [ citation needed ] The Sackler building, which was originally designed as an extension to the Fogg Museum, elicited worldwide attention from the time of Harvard's commission of Stirling to design the building, following a selection process that evaluated more than 70 architects. The university mounted an exhibition of the architects' preliminary design drawings in 1981 ( James Stirling's Design to Expand the Fogg Museum ), and issued a portfolio of Stirling's drawings to the press. [ citation needed ] After its completion in 1984, the building received widespread press coverage, with general acknowledgment of its significance as a Stirling design and a Harvard undertaking. Stirling employed an inventive design in an effort to let the museum peacefully co-exist with neighboring buildings in an area that he termed "an architectural zoo". Harvard published a 50-page book on the Sackler, with extensive color photos by Timothy Hursley, an interview with Stirling by Michael Dennis, a tribute to Arthur M. Sackler, and essays by Slive, Coolidge, and Rosenfield. [ citation needed ] In spite of international critical acclaim upon its opening, there have been outspoken critics of the building; Martin Peretz even proposed its demolition (though his case was undermined by mis-attributing the building to another British architect, Norman Foster ). The Sackler building was originally intended to include a 18-foot (5.5 m) wide by 150-foot (46 m) long "connector" or bridge to the second floor of the original Fogg Museum building located on the other side of Broadway, a major Cambridge thoroughfare. The massive addition was planned to house two galleries, a lounge, and a completely-enclosed connection between the buildings, accessible to visitors and museum staff. The suspended structure was to include a large oculus window high above the middle of the street, at the level of the large square opening still visible on the front of the Sackler building. The connector was postponed and never built, because of strong opposition from the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Association and local politicians. Eventually, an extensive renovation and expansion of the original Fogg Museum building would render the unbuilt connector proposal moot. In front of the entrance to the Sackler building, two monolithic reinforced concrete pillars still stand, which were originally intended to support the connector structure. In 2013, the future use of the Sackler building was uncertain, as its collection had been relocated to the Renzo Piano expansion of the Fogg building. In January 2019, after undergoing an 18-month renovation, the Sackler building was re-opened as an educational and research facility containing no significant public exhibition spaces. The building continues to house a sizable lecture hall at its basement level, which is primarily used for educational purposes. From its original opening in 1984, the building has encompassed the university's department of the History of Art and Architecture.

Photo by Josephine Sittenfeld Curator, educator, and scholar, now at RISD Museum, will start in new post Aug. 12 Sarah Ganz Blythe, a highly respected curator, educator, and scholar with more than 25 years of museum experience, will be the new Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums, interim Provost John Manning announced Wednesday. Ganz Blythe is joining Harvard from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) Museum, where she is currently deputy director, exhibitions, education, and programs. She will take her post as director on Aug. 12. “We are delighted that Sarah Ganz Blythe has agreed to become the Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums beginning this summer,” Manning said. “Sarah brings to her role not only great knowledge, creativity, judgment, and leadership experience, but also a deep commitment to teaching, learning, collaboration, and engagement with our museums’ extraordinary communities. Especially with the opportunities presented by the vast increase in public attendance since the Harvard Art Museums began offering free admission last June, Sarah’s experience and leadership perspective will serve Harvard and the museums well in this exciting time in their history.” Ganz Blythe has held leadership positions at the RISD Museum for the past 15 years, including serving as its interim director from 2020 to 2023. In this role, she led the institution through the pandemic to its current state, with rebounded attendance, expanded board participation, a balanced budget, a robust traveling exhibition program, an increase in acquisitions by underrepresented artists, and refurbished galleries. In addition to the RISD Museum, she has worked in curatorial and educational positions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art, both in New York. During her time as an undergraduate at Wellesley College, she was a conservation intern at the Harvard Art Museums. She has maintained deep connections to the Museums throughout her career, including as a visiting committee member in both 2017 and 2020. “As a student, my experiences with the Harvard Art Museums revealed the profound rewards of engaging deeply with and thinking expansively about art,” Ganz Blythe said. “I am thrilled to return and have the opportunity to guide this dynamic institution as it collaborates with students, faculty, staff, artists, and community partners.” “Sarah’s experience and leadership perspective will serve Harvard and the museums well in this exciting time in their history.” Ganz Blythe holds a B.A. in art history from Wellesley College and a Ph.D. in modern art from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. She has taught at Brown University, Wellesley College, and RISD, and has published widely throughout her career on the complicated histories of museums, art pedagogy, and underrepresented women artists. “Sarah brings a breadth of perspective, built throughout an impressive career, to this important role at Harvard,” said interim President Alan M. Garber. “Among her many strengths, her creativity in engaging students and her passion for teaching ensure that the Museums will extend their excellence as an academic and cultural resource as they enter a new era.” Ganz Blythe’s publications include “Why Art Museums? The Unfinished Work of Alexander Dorner,” with Andrew Martinez, and “Nancy Elizabeth Prophet: I Will Not Bend an Inch,” with Dominic Molon and Kajette Solomon. She has received numerous awards and fellowships including, this year, the Kress Foundation/Association of Art Museum Curators Fellowship at the American Academy in Rome. “As an institutional leader, Sarah listens with care and embraces differences of perspective, all the while seeking opportunities for integration and mutual regard,” said Robin Kelsey, dean of arts and humanities in the FAS and a member of the search committee. “In this moment, I can think of no better person to lead the Harvard Art Museums, an institution dear to so many on this campus and beyond.” Ganz Blythe’s appointment is the culmination of a nationwide search that included outreach to hundreds of stakeholders in collaboration with a University-wide search advisory committee. She will succeed Martha Tedeschi , who is retiring from her post on June 30 after leading Harvard Art Museums since July 2016. “I look forward to building on Martha Tedeschi’s achievements and joining the remarkable staff engaged in original research, generative learning, and open engagement,” Ganz Blythe said. The Harvard Art Museums — the Fogg Museum, Busch-Reisinger Museum, and Arthur M. Sackler Museum — are dedicated to advancing and supporting learning at Harvard University, in the community, and around the world. The Museums have played a leading role in the development of art history, conservation, and conservation science, and in the evolution of the art museum as an institution. The museums’ collections comprise a quarter-million works that span from ancient times to the present, with art from the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Mediterranean, and Asia. The Special Exhibitions Gallery presents important new research on artists and artistic practice, and the University Galleries are programmed in consultation with Harvard faculty to support coursework.

Photo: © President and Fellows of Harvard College; courtesy of the Harvard Art Museums Works will go on display in March exhibition, examining the artist’s experimental printmaking and painting techniques Harvard Art Museums Communications An extraordinary gift of 62 prints and two paintings by Edvard Munch, as well as one print by Jasper Johns, from the collection of Philip A. ’37 and Lynn G. Straus was announced by Harvard Art Museums on Tuesday. The spring 2025 exhibition, “Edvard Munch: Technically Speaking,” will feature many of the recently gifted works. The bequest is a final act of generosity from the Strauses following a relationship with the museums that began in the 1980s and that includes multiple gifts of artworks over the years; the support of a 1990s-era expansion, renovation, and endowment of the museums’ conservation center; and the endowment of specific conservation and curatorial positions. The works by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) in the Strauses’ bequest join an important concentration of paintings and prints by the artist already at Harvard and build upon multiple past gifts and assisted purchases of Munch’s work by the couple — 117 works altogether. The total number of works by the artist in the Harvard Art Museums’ collections is now 142 (eight paintings and 134 prints), constituting one of the largest and most significant collections of works by Munch in the U.S. The Strauses have been among the Harvard Art Museums’ most generous benefactors. In 1969, the couple purchased their first print by Munch, “Salome” (1903), an acquisition that marked the start of their passion for the artist’s work. Following a commitment to a $7.5 million gift in 1994, the museums’ conservation center — the oldest fine arts conservation treatment, research, and training facility in the U.S. — was renamed the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies . Philip, a New York investment adviser and portfolio manager, passed away in 2004, and their bequest comes to Harvard following Lynn’s passing in 2023. In total, the couple gifted or enabled purchases of 128 works to the Harvard Art Museums over their lifetimes, including works by Max Beckmann, Georges Braque, Alexander Calder, Timothy David Mayhew, and Emil Nolde.

Photo: © President and Fellows of Harvard College; courtesy of the Harvard Art Museums “We are immensely grateful to Philip and Lynn Straus for their generosity and stewardship over these many years,” said Sarah Ganz Blythe, the Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums. “Their enthusiasm for the work of Edvard Munch ensures generations of students and visitors can experience and study his prints and paintings here in Cambridge. Through their distinct style of collecting Munch’s prints — seeking out and acquiring multiple images of the same theme — they created a collection that affords deep insights into the artist’s practice and is therefore a perfect match for a university museum with a strong teaching and research mission.” Ganz Blythe continued: “Their support of the conservators and conservation scientists in the Straus Center has had a transformative impact on the numerous fellows who have trained there, as well as provided a facility where every object in our collections can be cared for and scientifically researched.” The Strauses’ recent bequest includes Munch’s iconic painting “ Two Human Beings (The Lonely Ones)” (1906–8) and “Train Smoke ” (1910), both of which are now in the collection of the Busch-Reisinger Museum, one of the Harvard Art Museums’ three constituent museums. These paintings join “Winter in Kragerø” (1915) and “Inger in a Red Dress” (1896), previously given to the museum by Lynn in memory of Philip in 2012. Philip and Lynn Straus with their first Edvard Munch print, “Salome” (1903), c. 1969. Courtesy Philip A. Straus Jr. In “Two Human Beings (The Lonely Ones),” a man and woman stand side by side yet still feel isolated from one another, facing toward the sea and away from the viewer, each embedded in a colorfully sedimented landscape. Munch first painted this subject around 1892 and returned to it repeatedly in his printmaking and painting thereafter. “Train Smoke,” which depicts nature disrupted but also dynamically animated by the Industrial Revolution, is a landscape unlike those by Munch already in the collection. Both paintings demonstrate Munch’s experimentation with color and surface texture, through his varied use of thick impasto, diluted paint drips, and even areas of bare canvas, a hallmark of Munch’s artistic legacy. “It is hard to overestimate the significance of Munch’s painting ‘Two Human Beings (The Lonely Ones).’ Capturing the tension between proximity and distance — spatial as well as emotional — the work addresses the universal theme of the human condition,” said Lynette Roth, the Daimler Curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum at the Harvard Art Museums. “The Strauses had generously loaned their painting for the inaugural installation of the renovated Harvard Art Museums building that opened in November 2014, and we are thrilled to be able to teach with and display it alongside the other significant paintings from their collection going forward.” Over the course of 2024, both paintings have undergone cleaning and other treatments by Kate Smith, senior conservator of paintings and head of the Paintings Lab, and Ellen Davis, associate paintings conservator, both in the museums’ Straus Center. “Two Human Beings (The Lonely Ones)” had been varnished at some point in its history, which is not consistent with Munch’s practice of leaving his canvases without a unified glossy surface. “Train Smoke” needed paint stabilization and cleaning to remove atmospheric grime. After careful study, removal of the varnish and grime from the paint surface, and treatment of small areas of paint loss, the paintings are now in closer alignment with their original appearance. The 62 prints in the Strauses’ recent bequest have entered the collection of the Fogg Museum. The majority are highly prized impressions that Munch exhibited in his lifetime, and they speak to the aesthetic he preferred for the display of his prints: Some of the impressions are cut to the image, and adhered to larger, heavy brown paper, which Munch signed and often dated. Also included are multiple states of single compositions. They showcase the range of techniques the artist used in his printmaking practice: drypoint, etching, lithography, mezzotint, and woodcut, and innovations through the addition of hand-applied color such as watercolor, crayon, and oil, or printing with woodblocks sawn into pieces. “With this bequest, the Harvard Art Museums have become an important destination for the research of Munch’s prints,” said Elizabeth M. Rudy, the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Curator of Prints at the Harvard Art Museums. “There are innumerable ways the collection offers opportunities for teaching, exhibition, and further study. Noteworthy for its groups of versions, states, and variations of single compositions, this collection offers wide-ranging insights into Munch’s innovative practice as a printmaker.” The Jasper Johns print included in the bequest, “Savarin” (1982), is a lithograph and monotype; it depicts a Savarin-brand coffee can filled with paintbrushes of various sizes. The backdrop incorporates the artist’s signature “crosshatch” work of the 1970s, which is represented in other prints by Johns in the museums’ collections. The arm shown at the bottom of the print is a reference to the skeletal arm shown in Munch’s “Self-Portrait” from 1895 — a connection the couple noted by hanging the two prints near each other in their own home. Visitors are welcome to view the prints and paintings, by appointment, in the Harvard Art Museums’ Art Study Center. The special exhibition “Edvard Munch: Technically Speaking,” on display March 7 to July 27 at the Harvard Art Museums, will include many of the works from the Strauses’ recent bequest as well as from prior gifts. The exhibition will showcase roughly 70 works, with key loans from the Munchmuseet in Oslo, Norway, and will include examples of the artist’s materials used for printmaking.

Title: Greening the Harvard Art Museums
Date: January 23, 2015

“[W]e wanted to set the standard for energy conservation and green building in the museum setting,” said Peter Atkinson (photo 1), the Harvard Art Museums’ director of facilities planning and capital management. Jon Chase/Harvard Staff Photographer Colin Durrant Harvard Correspondent On an overcast winter afternoon, plenty of natural light still streams through the “ Light Machine ” into the Calderwood Courtyard of the renovated Harvard Art Museums. While staring through the giant skylight, a visitor might notice that all of the light fixtures in the interior courtyard are turned off. The darkened lights are just one example of how energy efficiency and environmental responsibility were painstakingly considered in the design and construction of the 204,000-square-foot facility. Driven by Harvard’s commitment to sustainability and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, green building techniques, ranging from super-efficient LED lightbulbs to innovative water-conservation technology, were considered at every stage of the museums’ renovation . That dedication was recently rewarded when the museums achieved LEED Gold certification for the project from the U.S. Green Building Council. “We always knew the new Harvard Art Museums would be deeply connected to Harvard’s core mission, and that included sustainability,” said Thomas W. Lentz, the Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums. “We worked in close partnership with the University’s green-building experts over the years to realize a new facility that would support Harvard’s commitment to environmental sustainability and spur green innovation in the museum world. Today, the Harvard Art Museums are proud to be the newest member of Harvard’s green campus.” Conventional wisdom holds that because of strict temperature and climate requirements for protecting artwork, energy conservation in museum buildings is exceedingly difficult to master. At the Harvard Art Museums, the facilities team welcomed the challenge. The heating and cooling systems include enthalpy wheels that recover energy from waste heat, as well as thousands of sensors that monitor the indoor climate in real time. Additionally, the more than 400 shades that can cover the glass ceiling not only reduce energy use from artificial lighting by flooding the museum with natural light, they are also continually adjusted to help keep the museum cool in the summer and warmer in the winter. “We recognize that we are part of a community that values sustainability. And because of that, we wanted to set the standard for energy conservation and green building in the museum setting,” said Peter Atkinson, the museums’ director of facilities planning and capital management. One of the toughest sustainability challenges that the museums’ project team tackled was deciding what kind of lighting would best display Harvard’s world-renowned collection of artwork. The intention was to use energy-efficient LED bulbs that save energy and cut maintenance costs, thanks to their extended life. Atkinson and his team first partnered with the conservation department to ensure that the new lighting would not impact the preservation of the art, nor how visitors see flesh tones and other colors in the works. “From a preservation standpoint, the safety of LED lights for displaying artworks and their ability to provide high-quality, consistent color rendering were our primary concerns,” said Angela Chang, assistant director and conservator of objects and sculpture at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies. “We researched and confirmed these capabilities and also realized an additional benefit of lightbulbs with long life spans. With less frequent lifts and ladders in gallery spaces, we could reduce the potential for risk to the art.” After months of testing and careful consideration , the museums installed LED bulbs to light the entire collection, in close to 2,000 fixtures. Not only do the new bulbs provide an even wash of light across the color spectrum, they eliminate the problem of heat stratification in gallery spaces. Conventional incandescent bulbs produce extra heat, creating a “heat cloud” along the ceiling that requires cooling. Because LED bulbs produce dramatically less heat, additional cooling costs have been eliminated. The decision to pioneer the use of LED bulbs on such a large scale has had a ripple effect beyond Harvard. As word spread of their use at Harvard, the University’s vendor reported a significant uptick in requests to use them in museum settings. The new and revamped building was designed with the surrounding natural ecosystem in mind. An innovative water-recovery system collects rainwater from the museums and neighboring Carpenter Center and diverts it to a 10,000-gallon underground cistern. The reclaimed water , which otherwise would be discharged to the surrounding storm sewers at a daily rate of 21,600 gallons, is instead used for irrigation, gray water in toilets, and to recharge the underground water table. Waterless urinals and other water-efficient fixtures further reduce water use inside the museums. It is estimated that as a result of these changes, water use for irrigation will be reduced by 75 percent and in bathrooms by 81 percent. Waste was a serious consideration, especially during the construction process. Ninety-six percent of all construction-related waste and debris was diverted from landfills. Prior to renovation, the art museums donated many of their gallery lighting fixtures, exhibition display cases, and office furnishings to more than two dozen nonprofit organizations, including other museums and organizations on campus. Sculptor and artist Liz Glynn ’03 even used recycled concrete from the renovation to create full-scale replicas of Le Corbusier’s iconic furniture when she returned to campus as the Josep Lluis Sert Practitioner in the Arts at the Corbusier-designed Carpenter Center. The museums’ commitment to sustainability did not end when the final brick was laid. A post-completion commissioning project will continually evaluate and verify the performance of the building’s mechanical systems, while also identifying new opportunities for operational efficiency. “The LEED Gold certification of Harvard Art Museums, especially their path-breaking use of LEDs to light their collection, is a wonderful example of how the University’s commitment to sustainability cuts across every possible space type on campus, from labs and classrooms to dining halls and museums,” said Heather Henriksen, director of the Harvard Office for Sustainability.
