Houghton Library , on the south side of Harvard Yard adjacent to Widener Library , Lamont Library , and Loeb House, is Harvard University 's primary repository for rare books and manuscripts. It is part of the Harvard College Library, the library system of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences . The collections of Houghton Library include the Harvard Theatre Collection and the Woodberry Poetry Room , as well as the personal papers and archives of major American and English writers. Harvard's first special collections library began as the Treasure Room of Gore Hall in 1908. The Treasure Room moved to the newly built Widener Library in 1915. In 1938, looking to supply Harvard's most valuable holdings with more space and improved storage conditions, Harvard College Librarian Keyes DeWitt Metcalf made a series of proposals which eventually led to the creation of Houghton Library, Lamont Library , and the New England Deposit Library . Funding for Houghton was raised privately, with the largest portion coming from Arthur A. Houghton Jr. , in the form of stock in Corning Glass Works . Construction was largely completed by the fall of 1941, and the library opened on February 28, 1942. [ citation needed ] Along with much else, Houghton holds collections of papers of Samuel Johnson , Emily Dickinson , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , Margaret Fuller , John Keats , Ralph Waldo Emerson and his family, Amos Bronson Alcott and his daughter Louisa May Alcott , along with the papers of other notable transcendentalists . Significant collections include those relating to Theodore Roosevelt , T.S. Eliot , E.E. Cummings , Henry James , William James , James Joyce , John Updike , Jamaica Kincaid , Tennessee Williams , The Cockettes , John Lithgow , Gore Vidal , and many others.

The renovation represents a key component of a larger vision for the rare books library, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year. It serves as a research center and teaching laboratory for students and faculty across many disciplines that use primary sources, hosting nearly 300 class visits each year and programming a series of exhibitions and events that draw a range of visitors from across Harvard and surrounding communities. To expand its reach vastly, the library’s digitization efforts have placed its collections within reach of researchers around the world. “We want all of Houghton Library — the collections, the building, and our expert staff — to generate interest in and passion for the humanities, the arts, the social sciences, and more,” said Thomas Hyry, Florence Fearrington Librarian of Houghton Library. “Our efforts to create a more inclusive atmosphere and to increase access to Houghton’s collections and services will ensure the library becomes an even more active and highly valued resource for Harvard and the world at large.” The renovations were made possible through generous donations, including a major gift from philanthropist and bibliophile Peter J. Solomon ’60, M.B.A. ’63, and his wife, Susan, whose extensive collection of rare and treasured children’s literature and illustrations provided the catalyst for the renovation. The Solomon collection includes a copy of the suppressed first edition of “Alice in Wonderland,” as well as additional works by Lewis Carroll, Beatrix Potter, Edward Lear, and other authors. The Solomons’ promised donation sparked an effort to make Houghton more welcoming to the Harvard community and visitors alike. Plans include a fully accessible entrance with ramped walkways and new trees and plantings. Renderings courtesy of Ann Beha Architects “Peter’s gift is a testament to his profound love of books, his belief in the power of literature to change lives, and the essential role of the library in the life of the University and in society at large,” said Sarah E. Thomas, vice president for the Harvard Library and University librarian and Roy E. Larsen Librarian for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “There are so many people his generous support will affect: students, faculty, researchers, and visitors from around the world, and of course the staff who support the critical work of the library. I know our gratitude is deep.” “We wanted our collection to be where it would join similar holdings and be enjoyed by the widest possible audience,” Solomon said. “Houghton houses extraordinary material and enjoys a prime location within the Yard, but more Harvard students should explore its treasures. “Redesigning the entrance, integrating the building more prominently into its surroundings, and creating a more dynamic set of interior spaces will encourage greater appreciation of the library,” he added. Construction will begin next September, and the building will be closed until September 2020. During renovations, the Houghton Reading Room will return to its original location, the Periodicals Reading Room in Widener Library. Classrooms in Widener Library, Pusey Library, and Lamont Library will accommodate courses that use Houghton collections for teaching. Houghton is working with Ann Beha Architects and partnering with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Office of Physical Resources and Planning on the two-year project. The renovation will include redesigning the landscape between Quincy Street and the library entrance; replacing the daunting main entrance staircases with elegant paths at a wheelchair-accessible gradual incline; and connecting a plaza to the entrance, creating more space for people to gather outside. Natural light will be introduced to the entrance lobby, which will feature a dynamic exhibition gallery displaying materials drawn from the library’s collections. A new elevator will take visitors to the teaching spaces, exhibition gallery, and special thematic rooms on the second floor. Ground-floor restrooms will be remodeled and expanded. Improvements to Houghton’s reading room will include a soundproof entry and help-desk area, and an adjacent room where library users can work with materials in collaboration with library staff. The plans have the enthusiastic support of the University, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the Harvard Library. “Today’s libraries are much more deeply engaged in teaching and outreach, and in an era where digital information is so prevalent, connecting people with our special collections and original materials which resonate with the context of their time and form is a key goal of Harvard Library,” said Thomas. “As a member of the Harvard College Library and Harvard Library, Houghton plays an important role in opening up the magic of collections and libraries to all visitors, as well as supporting research and teaching.”

Title: The genesis of genius

Nine miniature manuscript books (photos 1, 3), six by Charlotte Brontë and three by Patrick Branwell Brontë, are part of the collections at Houghton Library. The library repaired, rehoused, and digitized the books, which are nearly 200 years old. “These tiny books help to evoke the whole experience of the Brontë children,” says Houghton curator Leslie Morris (photo 2). Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Kate Kondayen Harvard Library Communications Flames of childhood passion often die. How many astronauts and ballerinas are among us? Yet some talent is so profound that even early efforts signify genius. The tiny, hand-lettered, hand-bound books Charlotte and Branwell Brontë made as children surely qualify. Measuring about 2.5 by 5 centimeters, page after mini-page brims with poems, stories, songs, illustrations, maps, building plans, and dialogue. The books, lettered in minuscule, even script, tell of the “Glass Town Confederacy,” a fictional world the siblings created for and around Branwell’s toy soldiers, which were both the protagonists of and audience for the little books. In 1829 and 1830, Charlotte and Branwell cobbled the pages together from printed waste and scrap paper, perhaps cut from margins of discarded pamphlets. They wrote with steel-nibbed pens, which tend to blot, yet the even script demonstrates their practiced hand. Charlotte, who in adulthood wrote “Jane Eyre,” nested leaves together, then neatly sewed the spine with embroidery thread; it’s evident she constructed her book and planned its content before ever putting pen to paper. Branwell, who would become a painter and poet, stacked folded leaves together, which allowed him to add pages as he needed; clearly not as adept with needle and thread as his sister, he stab-sewed the leaves together with thicker linen yarn. Children can be rough on their playthings — miniature books created by the younger Brontë siblings Emily and Anne did not survive — but Charlotte kept and stored the “Glass Town” adventures carefully. “They must have been very precious to them, as they are to us today,” said Priscilla Anderson of Harvard’s Weissman Preservation Center , who restored the volumes. Only about 20 volumes of Brontë juvenilia are known to remain. Harvard holds nine, the Brontë Museum at the family home in England owns a few, and the remaining are scattered among museums and private collectors. Until recently, juvenilia — works produced by an author or artist while still young — were viewed as oddities by scholars and collectors. Today they are understood to provide valuable and rare insight into an author’s development. In the case of the Brontës, experts might trace Gothic influences from the 13-year-old Charlotte’s stories, or identify Branwell’s growth as an artist by comparing his childhood illustrations and his later paintings. Perhaps even more importantly, the books provide a glimpse into the inner lives of children growing up in a society in which they were expected to be seen and not heard. “What is extraordinary is the extent to which they imitated a professional publication, the variety of the content, and the perseverance it required,” said Anderson. “The ability to make these volumes from start to finish out of scraps is impressive.” At nearly 200 years old, the books are delicate. Over time, the paper became increasingly fragile, the adhesive used to mount the volumes damaged the covers, and the tiny script was hard for scholars to read. To ensure that scholars today and tomorrow have access to these treasures, the library repaired, rehoused, and digitized the books. Their unusual size, age, and nature presented several challenges to Anderson and Debora Mayer, the Helen H. Glaser Conservator at Weissman. “Perhaps children’s eyes and hands can read and manipulate these things, but for grownups they’re microscopic,” explained Anderson, who said she felt like she had giant’s hands when she worked on the books. To repair tears, Anderson used fine surgical instruments, teasing out and pasting down individual fibers of kozo paper about the width of a human hair. (Kozo is a fine paper made from the inner bark of an Asian plant, and is regularly used to mend books.) All through the painstaking work, she knew even a small mistake would be magnified. “I held my breath, literally,” said Anderson, “to keep fragments of paper from blowing away.” New binding exposed text in the gutters of Branwell’s volumes for the first time in 170 years, and the digital technology deployed provides clarity beyond that of the human eye. Technicians moved the camera very slightly on multiple takes and combined them into one image. Every millimeter is sharply focused. Charlotte’s husband sold the volumes after her death to a collector, who gave them to poet and fellow collector Amy Lowell; she donated the set to Houghton Library in 1925. The digital copies of the Brontë juvenilia have largely met scholars’ needs, according to Houghton curator Leslie Morris. Yet the awe-inspiring physicality of the books as artifacts cannot be captured on screen. “These tiny books help to evoke the whole experience of the Brontë children. Here they are, living in a somewhat isolated parsonage in Yorkshire, having only themselves as playmates and needing to entertain each other,” Morris said. “Seeing the physical object brings home the effort and intelligence it took to create them and why they created them. Having grown up with Brontë, it’s a way of connecting with the past through objects.” The nine Brontë volumes held by Harvard referenced in this story are available in full, free, online: By Charlotte Brontë: Scenes on the great bridge , November 1829 The silver cup: a tale , October 1829 Blackwoods young mens magazine , August 1829 An interesting passage in the lives of some eminent personages of the present age , June 1830 The poetaster: a drama in two volumes , July 1830 The adventures of Mon. Edouard de Crack , February 1830 By Patrick Branwell Brontë: Branwells Blackwoods magazine , June 1829 Magazine , January 1829 Branwells Blackwoods magazine , July 1829

Title: Users give Houghton renovation a thumbs-up

Lewis Day (pictured) speaks from the new reading room desk. Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Anna Burgess Harvard Library Communications Literature Professor David Stern had planned to teach his first-year seminar, “Harvard’s Greatest Hits,” on the history of books and their physical forms, last academic year in a newly renovated space at Houghton Library. But due to the pandemic, Houghton was closed for nearly double the 12 months scheduled for its renovation. It wasn’t until after the library reopened to students, faculty, and staff in September that Stern finally found himself back in its classrooms, leading a discussion on materiality as his students examined shards of pottery, delicate papyrus fragments, and parchment scrolls. Teaching in the new Houghton, he said, was worth the wait. “It’s spectacular,” said Stern, Harvard’s Harry Starr Professor of Classical and Modern Jewish and Hebrew Literature. “It’s more welcoming, more friendly. I’m so impressed with the job they did.” In a typical year, Houghton engages a multitude of scholars and is one of the libraries at Harvard that receives the most visitors from outside the University. The world-renowned research center and teaching laboratory holds millions of primary sources and hosts open exhibitions and events every year, as well as nearly 300 visits from classes like Stern’s. It is expected to reopen to visiting researchers on Monday. When construction on the building was completed in February, library staff couldn’t wait for its safe reopening to users, said Thomas Hyry, the Florence Fearrington Librarian of Houghton Library. “As wonderful as it was to see construction completed, we were even more excited for the day when the spaces could be used again,” Hyry said. “The work done to renovate Houghton was meant to be appreciated not only by staff members but by students, faculty, and the community.” After all, he said, the vision for the project was to create a more welcoming and accessible building that all community members could use and enjoy. The renovation was led by Ann Beha Architects in partnership with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Office of Physical Resources and Planning. It was funded in part by generous gifts from alumni, including Peter J. Solomon ’60, M.B.A. ’63, and his wife, Susan, who also gave a children’s literature collection to the library and an additional gift to construct a new gate in Harvard Yard . The reopening of all library buildings this year has been gratifying, said University Librarian Martha Whitehead, and Houghton especially so. “Library users are returning to a space that is instrumental to their teaching, learning, or research,” Whitehead said. “In addition to this, Houghton is now an enhanced version of the space they knew and can serve their needs even better than before.” On a brief tour through the building this month, Hyry pointed out some of the new things he and his colleagues are most excited for users to experience. The changes to Houghton are evident before stepping through its doors, as the front of the building now includes a grand staircase and two wheelchair-accessible paths — as well as the new Appell Plaza, gift of the Powder Mill Foundation in honor of Louis J. Appell Jr. ’47, and Josephine S. Appell. These renovations are part of a conscious shift to make Houghton easier to navigate, Hyry said. Inside the building, new features include visitor elevators and lockers; gender-neutral, wheelchair-accessible restrooms; modernized wayfinding and signage; and a welcome ambassador in the lobby to greet and provide information to visitors. A map and library guide are available to visitors at the welcome desk. Houghton’s bright, freshly painted lobby now boasts new exhibition and display spaces that left researcher and frequent Houghton user Elizabeth Rudy “gushing” on her first visit to the reopened building. Display cases in the oval lobby have replaced bookcases and will highlight changing samples of Houghton’s varied and diverse collections. The exhibit currently includes an 11th-century Quranic manuscript, an early draft of Sylvia Plath’s poem “Sickroom Tulips,” and two books printed in the Massachusett language at the Harvard Indian College in the late 1600s. An additional new case located off the lobby displays materials related to historical intellectual breakthroughs, especially in the history of science. The displayed materials come from Houghton as well as an anonymous alumni donor who generously funded the renovation of the library’s reading room. The fall 2021 installation on “Nicolaus Copernicus’ Sun-Centered Solar System” features materials by Copernicus and his pupil Rheticus. All the new cases and lighting were designed by Boston-based firm IKD, whose principals are Harvard alumni Yugon Kim, M.Arch. ’04, and Tomomi Itakura, M.Arch. ’04, and partially funded by the David P. Wheatland Charitable Trust. Rudy, the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Curator of Prints at the Harvard Art Museums, who was one of the first researchers to return to Houghton in person this month, said she was “blown away” by the renovated exhibition spaces, as well as the information in the exhibits themselves. “It’s a transformed, inspiring group of spaces,” Rudy said. “I learned so much in just a short period of time.” The first special exhibition in the renovated building is “Animals Are Us: Anthropomorphism in Children’s Literature,” featuring many items from the Peter J. Solomon Collection recently gifted to the library. In 2018, Solomon gave Houghton a rare first edition of “Alice in Wonderland,” also pledging to donate the rest of his collection and underwrite the library’s renovation. “Peter has become a major supporter of Houghton and his generosity has had a significant impact on the library in many ways,” said Hyry. “His collection has enabled us to install an exhibition that at once welcomes a broad audience and engages critically with and gives us new ways to think about a well-known genre of literature.” “Animals Are Us” explores the whimsy and creativity of stories about animals, Hyry said, as well as raises questions about why such characters are so common and whether this comes at the expense of diverse human characters. The exhibition was guest curated by H. Nichols B. Clark ’69, founding director and chief curator emeritus of the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, and Meghan Melvin, Jean S. and Frederic A. Sharf Curator of Design in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It opened on Sept. 1 and will run until Jan. 7, 2022. Houghton’s reading room has been brightened, modernized, and made more accessible. The room was refurnished with ADA-accessible tables, adjustable-height chairs, comfortable armchairs, and glowing overhead lighting. The walls are now a calming blue and ivory, and soundproof glass separates a help-desk area and group study room from the main room. Hyry said the additional spaces within the reading room will allow for different kinds of engagement between researchers, librarians, and collections. A researcher new to the library could ask questions about a collection without disturbing other users, for instance, or a group of students in the same class could examine and discuss materials together. For solo researchers like Rudy, meanwhile, the main room is now quieter and enables better focus. Rudy said it’s the perfect place, after using HathiTrust for months, for her to “reunite with the texts.” Lewis Day is pictured at the new reading room desk. The classrooms feature upgraded technology and furniture. Stern, who has visited with his class, said aesthetic changes make the rooms feel brighter, while new technology and movable furniture mean the spaces are “much more flexible” for collaborative work and engaging with collection materials. Doctoral candidate Julia Viani Puglisi, who is studying Egyptology, presented to Stern’s class in September. She said being in the new classrooms underscored the importance of multimedia learning. Puglisi is all for digitizing library materials; in fact, she worked on a 2019 project to three-dimensionally scan ancient pottery shards held at Houghton and make them available to students. But she also thinks the materiality of the objects — what they’re made of, their texture, their shape — can only be really understood in person. In the new Houghton, with cutting-edge technology in the same spaces as thousand-year-old objects, users can now have both.
