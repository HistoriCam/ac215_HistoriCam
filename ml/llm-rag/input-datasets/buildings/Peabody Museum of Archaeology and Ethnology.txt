The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology is a museum affiliated with Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts , United States. Founded in 1866, the Peabody Museum is one of the oldest and largest museums focusing on anthropological material, with particular focus on the ethnography and archaeology of the Americas . The museum is caretaker to over 1.2 million objects, some 900 feet (270 m) of documents, 2,000 maps and site plans, and about 500,000 photographs. The museum is located at Divinity Avenue on the Harvard University campus. The museum is one of the four Harvard Museums of Science and Culture open to the public. The museum was established through an October 8, 1866, gift from wealthy American financier and philanthropist George Peabody , a native of South Danvers (now eponymously named Peabody, Massachusetts ). Peabody committed $150,000 to be used, according to the terms of the trust, to establish the position of Peabody Professor-Curator, to purchase artifacts, and to construct a building to house its collections. Peabody directed his trustees to organize the construction of "a suitable fireproof museum building, upon land to be given for that purpose, free of cost or rental, by the President and Fellows of Harvard College". In 1867, the museum opened its first exhibition, which consisted of a small number of prehistoric artifacts from the Merrimack Valley in Harvard University's Boylston Hall . In 1877, the long-awaited museum building was completed and ready for occupancy. The building that houses the Peabody was expanded in 1888 and again in 1913. Peabody Museum is steward to archaeological, ethnographic, osteological , and archival collections from many countries and covering millions of years of human cultural, social, and biological history, with particular focus on the cultures of North and South America and the Pacific Islands , as well as collections from Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology cares for most of the items at the University that fall under NAGPRA’s purview. A recent letter from U.S. senators and members of the Senate’s Committee on Indian Affairs requested an update on Harvard’s processes and pace of repatriation under NAGPRA. The Peabody responded with an in-depth description of the Museum’s policies and methods, including the assessment that strong support by the University’s administration and the doubling of NAGPRA-dedicated staff over the past year have greatly sped the Peabody’s rate of repatriation. To gain a greater understanding of the Peabody’s progress and processes regarding NAGPRA, the Gazette recently sat down with Matthew Liebmann , chair of the Peabody’s Faculty Committee, Peabody Professor of American Archaeology and Ethnology, and chair of Harvard’s Department of Anthropology; Kelli Mosteller , executive director of the Harvard University Native American Program; and Jane Pickering , the William and Muriel Seabury Howells Director of the Peabody Museum. Matthew Liebmann, Kelli Mosteller, and Jane Pickering. Harvard file photos GAZETTE: Why is Harvard in such a unique position here? LIEBMANN: The Peabody, as with Harvard University more generally, is the inheritor of the long legacy of American history and all that entails — including colonialism, dispossession, and enslavement. We have the weight of nearly 400 years on our shoulders. We are also the inheritors of collections amassed over that period and the privilege that went into the formation of these collections. It’s our ethical duty to address that heavy history. Repatriation is a fundamental part of that process. MOSTELLER: It’s important to understand that the scale of Harvard’s involvement is different than many other institutions. There are thousands of ancestors in the collections, and they came to be there as a result of practices that were deeply disrespectful and damaging to Native communities. We are one of the worst offenders, and that’s why Harvard’s actions, and lack of action, have attracted attention and criticism, and why we will be watched closely in terms of what steps we take next. PICKERING: When the University started this work in the 1990s, we were in touch with all 574 federally recognized tribes in the country. Our collecting practices had an impact on nearly every Tribal Nation, every community. GAZETTE: Why is this work important? MOSTELLER: Institutions with NAGPRA collections bear a profound responsibility to both the ancestors and to Native communities. We must acknowledge that real harm has been done. It is our duty to carry out each stage of this work with professionalism, but also deep empathy and unwavering compassion. When the NAGPRA-mandated portion of the work is done and the ancestors have been returned to their communities, that can’t be the end of our responsibility. That’s the beginning of the process for the people to whom these ancestors are being returned. There’s so much emotional, spiritual, and cultural labor still to be done. We have to be good allies and support those communities. LIEBMANN: Properly done, repatriation can open new opportunities for all involved in the process. The Peabody’s 1999 repatriation of the ancestors from Pecos Pueblo to Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico started a process that made possible my work that continues with Jemez today. Jemez was interested in establishing a mutually beneficial relationship coming out of the experience that they had with the Peabody. Many communities aren’t interested in continuing their relationships with museums after a repatriation, and understandably so. But for those that are interested in developing or enhancing a relationship with Harvard, the repatriation process can serve as a door to bring people from outside Harvard to our campus, and to bring people from Harvard into the outside world. GAZETTE: In 2021 President Larry Bacow apologized on behalf of the University for what he referred to as “practices that placed the academic enterprise above respect for the dead and human decency.” Do you feel that apology extends to what many have called the slow pace of this work on the part of Harvard? PICKERING: At the time President Bacow made his apology, I apologized to Native communities specifically for the practices that led to the collections of ancestors at the museum and for missteps we had made in our implementation of NAGPRA. I think historically the Peabody did not always act proactively and center its work on the impact of the history on affected communities. We must acknowledge that NAGPRA is about much more than a series of transactions and a one-time apology. It is about fundamental change to the structure, practices, and values of the museum — what we describe as ethical stewardship, which includes conversations, engagement, and shared authority with Tribal Nations. MOSTELLER: NAPGRA’s the floor, not the ceiling. It defines the bare minimum we have to do to be in compliance with the law, but we have a moral responsibility to do more, especially when we are genuinely engaging in consultation and we hear what communities need from us. We need to set their requests as our new standard. GAZETTE: How have you improved your processes? PICKERING: In the past year, we’ve more than doubled the size of our NAGPRA office, and we now have one of the largest staff devoted to NAGPRA in the nation. We also have new positions in other departments to provide the necessary support for NAGPRA activities. We added these significant resources as a foundation for our three-year commitment to support consultation and repatriation of all ancestors and their funerary belongings. We have also invested additional resources to consult with Tribal Nations and lineal descendants regarding the return of a large collection of hair clippings. Anthropologist George Woodbury, a Harvard lecturer, amassed hair clippings from Indigenous people around the world, including, heartbreakingly, from approximately 700 Native American children and adults then at U.S. Indian boarding schools. Woodbury’s collection was donated to the Peabody in 1938. I have personally spoken with Tribal representatives and lineal descendants from across the country, which has involved many tough conversations but also the honor of learning about the relatives’ stories and experiences. We’ve been working really hard, and the clippings are already going home to lineal descendants and communities. GAZETTE: What does this work look like going forward? What are you focused on in terms of where you want to make progress and what will community members see in the coming year and years? MOSTELLER: Every conversation I’ve had with a Tribal community during my first year at Harvard, whether it is regarding a campus visit or encouraging students from their Tribal community to apply, the first question asked is, “What about all of our ancestors that you’ve had for decades upon decades?” They don’t want to talk about anything else until we talk about NAGPRA and the ancestors. This is the domino that has to fall before the deeper partnerships that we want to have with Tribal communities can happen. From the Tribal communities’ perspectives, why would they want to send their kids where their ancestors are being held or kept as collection items? LIEBMANN: Also, the Peabody now has policies that go beyond NAGPRA. We are now able to do repatriations not only under the law, but for other objects, artifacts, materials, and ancestors not covered by NAGPRA that are currently stewarded by the Peabody. I think that’s an incredibly important change. PICKERING: Under these new policies, we recently legally transferred a warrior-whaler kayak to the Alutiiq community. It is the culmination of a partnership that began with a NAGPRA consultation back in 2002. It involved a long-term project for the conservation of the kayak, together with the community, as well as visits, workshops, and an exhibition. In 2016 the kayak was physically transferred to the Alutiiq Museum in Kodiak, Alaska, but it was not owned by the community. Rather, it was still owned by us. In 2023 we transferred legal ownership to the Alutiiq Museum, which meant the kayak has truly gone home to be cared for by the community. MOSTELLER: A part of true consultation is to legally transfer objects, even if the tribes are not in a position where they are ready to physically take possession. And that means listening to the tribe when they say that they do not have enough staff, they don’t have appropriate land for reburial, or they don’t have the resources to physically transfer at this time. It is still vitally important for this legal transfer to happen. It’s critical to always come back to the tribe to ask: Where are you in your process? How can we help? What do you need to be able to move to this next step? The relationship just doesn’t end when legal transfer has happened. If we are really practicing ethical stewardship, we still bear a responsibility.

Rindge, Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology, © President and Fellows of Harvard College Courtesy of Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology, © President and Fellows of Harvard College Jill Radsken Harvard Staff Writer For every remarkable object displayed in the new exhibition celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology , visitors might be just as impressed by some other object they can’t so readily see. There are more than 1.25 million items in the Peabody collections, only a choice sampling of which could fit into the display cases for the exhibition “All the World Is Here: Harvard’s Peabody Museum and the Invention of American Anthropology,” which opened in April. Alluring in another way, though, is the critical role the museum played in birthing a new social science. “It’s tempting to say that Frederic Putnam , who served here as the second director of the museum from 1875 to 1909, almost single-handedly invented American anthropology as an academic field,” said Castle McLaughlin, curator of North American ethnography. “He started the anthropology department in 1890 and chaired it, and was responsible for designing anthropology exhibits at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893, which led to the creation of the Field Museum of Natural History . He founded or co-founded dozens of publications and organizations. It’s amazing to realize all that he accomplished for museums and the field of anthropology.” More than 250,000 people visit the Peabody every year, and millions more enjoy pieces loaned to other museums around the world. “In some sense these collections belong to everyone,” said Jane Pickering , executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science & Culture . “We want everyone to experience and enjoy these collections through our exhibits and programs. This is one of the few places in the world where people can see such spectacular objects that represent the amazing diversity of human cultures.” Walking into the restored fourth-floor gallery, visitors see first a sledge that Adm. Robert Peary used on his 1891-92 exploration of Greenland. Putnam helped to support Peary’s expedition and asked him to collect Inuit objects for display at the 1893 Chicago fair. Peabody conservation specialists have identified the five species used to make the vehicle as narwhal, walrus, whale, caribou, and seal. “In the second half of the 19th century, Putman was a key figure in starting to codify theories and information about human prehistory. Then new technologies came along that enabled us to learn new things about our historic collections,” McLaughlin said. Many objects in the exhibition, including some from Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, are rarely seen treasures, and can prompt a double take from visitors. There’s a hand-carved effigy pipe of a flying man dressed in a sailor’s uniform, with an ornate pineapple design on his pants; a “FeeJee Mermaid,” a skeletal fish-monkey artifact made in the 1800s from papier-mâché, wood, and fish skin; a model replica of Serpent Mound , an indigenous prehistoric site in Ohio that Putnam purchased to protect the archaeological remains; and a sailor’s cap from Lewis and Clark’s early 1800s expedition to the American Northwest. “When most people think of anthropology, they think of curators going out and making systematic collections in distant, exotic places. But the earliest ethnographic collections in the Peabody were given by regional institutions such as the Massachusetts Historical Society and the Boston Athenaeum, where sea captains in the late-18th-century China trade deposited souvenirs they acquired from Native American trade partners on the Northwest Coast. Private patrons like Mary Hemenway played a huge role in supporting field research and donating collections, especially in the days before public funding existed,” said McLaughlin. So closely tied are the museum and Harvard’s Department of Anthropology that Gary Urton , acting director of the museum and chair of the department, said many faculty still informally carry the title of curator. “In the early days, the museum and the department were very closely connected. That close connection has existed for the history of the life of these two institutions, from the 1860s to the present day,” he said. Arches in the gallery set off objects and ephemera from the Chicago World’s Fair. Curators Ilisa Barbash and Diana Loren displayed a pair of sculptures known as “the Typical Man and Woman,” cast according to measurements taken from thousands of people, including Harvard students, by the director of the Hemenway gymnasium in the 1890s. “Some of the early research raises sensitive issues in today’s social and political climate. In addition, there was an inherent problem in the way collecting was done among what were then colonized or only recently decolonized societies. This exhibit provides the stimulus to think deeply and critically about such issues as earlier ideas of race and the conditions under which collections were formed. We don’t like to pretend these things didn’t happen,” said McLaughlin, who said the museum hosted a yearlong series of lectures titled “Race, Representation, and Museums” to address some of these topics in depth. Rather than aggressively acquiring new objects, the museum now works with Native American tribes to return sacred objects to their ancestral homes and to incorporate native voices in interpreting and understanding the materials. Many faculty and museum curators collaborate closely with groups to help preserve their history and traditions in the museum and beyond. William L. Fash , Bowditch Professor of Central American and Mexican Archaeology and Ethnology, and his wife, Barbara, director of the Peabody Museum’s Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions Program, have worked in Copan, Honduras, for nearly 40 years, studying and preserving Maya ruins, and working with government staff and local students and teachers in cultural heritage work. “We are standing on the shoulders of giants at the Peabody,” Fash said. “But now the countries and Native American communities we work in are deeply involved in historical archaeological inquiry. It’s actually fulfilling the original mission of the museum — archaeology and ethnology — in a conjoined way rather than in separate approaches. In some sense, the traditional roles are reversed in collaborative work of this sort because we scholars learn so much from the descendant populations, and we do our best to enhance their work in preserving traditional knowledge and practices.” Where future engagement will lead the Peabody is the question for the next 150 years, said Urton, who believes the role and work of anthropologists will continue to evolve. “Anthropology was initially interested in the colonized and the dispossessed. In this regard, the field wasn’t founded to study Western cultures; rather, its original focus was on non-Western societies. Now that we are all living in a global, transcultural world, these new circumstances cause us to rethink both the role of the museum and of anthropology in general,” he said. “We must ask: What is our role in the academy and in the world if our original subjects and their circumstances have changed so radically? Is it possible for anthropology and museums to remake themselves together? Or will there inevitably be a different path forward for each?” The Peabody Museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. except for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Day, and New Year’s Day.

Jane Pickering, who has been executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science & Culture since 2013, will take on a new role as the William and Muriel Seabury Howells Director of Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology effective July 1. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Manisha Aggarwal-Schifellite Harvard Staff Writer Jane Pickering has been named the William and Muriel Seabury Howells Director of Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology , Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Claudine Gay announced today. Pickering will begin her five-year term July 1. Pickering has been executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science & Culture (HMSC) since 2013. She was the first person to hold the post, overseeing public programming for a consortium of six partner museums: the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the Harvard University Herbaria, and the Mineralogical & Geological Museum (which collaborate as the Harvard Museum of Natural History ), the Semitic Museum, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology, and the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments . The Museums of Science & Culture will begin a search for a new director this summer. Pickering will oversee the curation, care and conservation, and programming of one of the oldest and largest collections of cultural objects in the Western Hemisphere. The Peabody was founded in 1866 and houses more than 1.2 million objects. “One of the most exciting aspects of the Peabody Museum is that there is enormous cross-campus interest in the collections and their potential. The museum is significant to faculty and students from across the University,” said Pickering. “The museum is also at a very critical point in its history. There has been a transformation in how we think about anthropological collections and how we address the profound challenges of their stewardship and interpretation. I look forward to building on the superb work that has already begun at the Peabody to take a leadership role in that arena.” Concurrently, Gay is creating a Peabody faculty executive committee to work closely with Pickering and her staff on museum programming, community engagement, and curation. The committee will report to Gay. “From the overwhelming number of responses to the canvass, it was clear that the Peabody has a large and engaged community invested in its future and that to fully realize our collective vision we need both the leadership of a world-class museum professional and robust faculty engagement,” Gay said in her announcement. “I am excited to have more faculty directly engaged in supporting the Peabody through this coming period of self-reflection and planning for the future.” “Jane Pickering has been the powerhouse who has successfully led the Harvard Museums of Science & Culture through its formative first years,” said Donald Pfister , chair of its faculty executive board, curator of the Farlow Library and Herbarium of Cryptogamic Botany, and Asa Gray Professor of Systematic Botany. “From administrative and budgetary reorganizations to developing the public face of the museums, she has managed with good cheer and a delicate hand. Although the HMSC will be losing Jane, we are delighted that she will remain in our midst to undertake new and exciting challenges in the Peabody Museum.” During the consortium’s first five years, museum attendance increased by 34 percent to almost 300,000 annual visitors. In 2017, more than 150 faculty members from FAS and other Schools participated in HMSC activities including curation, presentations, and program advising. Pickering also worked to expand the reach of HSMC programming in collaboration with other Harvard communities, including the multi-media event “ Native American Running: Culture, Health, Sport ,” co-sponsored with the Harvard Native American Program and the departments of Anthropology and Human and Evolutionary Biology, held in conjunction with the 2016 Boston Marathon. “It is immediately reassuring and exciting to have Jane Pickering step into the role of director at the Peabody Museum,” said Lawrence D. Bobo, dean of the Division of Social Sciences, W.E.B. Du Bois Professor of the Social Sciences, and Harvard College Professor. “The Peabody is a rare and invaluable repository of history and material culture. Accordingly, we have special obligations of stewardship that are borne on a day-to-day basis by the museum director. Dean Gay has made a truly fitting selection in appointing Jane.” Pickering has held positions at university museums for more than 30 years, including at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and the MIT Museum. Prior to joining Harvard, she was deputy director of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. In 2016, she was appointed to the National Museum and Library Services Board by President Barack Obama. “One would be truly hard-pressed to find a person who better embodied as rich a set of experiences in museum administration, public outreach and stakeholder relations, and deep appreciation of the research and teaching mission of a university-based museum than Jane,” said Bobo. “In her we have not only the combination of these qualities of museum expertise and savvy as well as a commitment to academic values, but someone who is already intimately familiar with and respected by Harvard faculty, those working in our various museums, collections and archives, and the larger Harvard community. I greatly look forward to working with Jane in this new role.” “Jane is deeply knowledgeable about Harvard’s museums and about the challenges and opportunities facing our cultural institutions in these times,” said Martha Tedeschi , Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums. “Her commitment to the care and stewardship of collections, and to access and learning opportunities for all, will situate the Peabody for maximum impact in the years to come. I greatly look forward to partnering with Jane in her new role and to seeing the Peabody flourish under her thoughtful and innovative leadership.” Pickering holds a master’s degree in natural sciences from the University of Cambridge and an M.S. in museum studies from the University of Leicester. She is an alumna of the Getty Leadership Institute’s Museum Management program.
