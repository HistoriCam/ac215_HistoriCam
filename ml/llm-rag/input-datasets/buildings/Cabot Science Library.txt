Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer FAS Communications Seamlessly blending diner-style study booths, flat-screen TVs, multiple social collaboration spaces, and a new “Discovery Bar” with the traditional stacks of books familiar in any library setting, the renewed Cabot Science Library opens today with a range of welcoming amenities and resources for the Harvard community. The unveiling marks the culmination of more than two years of planning and construction at the Science Center atrium and Cabot Science Library with the goal of better supporting learning and teaching for the digital age while effortlessly connecting the library to the atrium and plaza social spaces. “The environments in which our students study, collaborate, and socialize are an important part of the education we provide them,” said Michael D. Smith, Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). “The new Cabot Science Library provides a space that is both welcoming to our undergraduate community and improves upon Harvard’s world-leading reputation for research and educational innovation.” Built in 1973 and designed by Josep Lluís Sert, then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD), the Godfrey Lowell Cabot Science Library serves as Harvard’s general science library, supporting learning and research in STEM subjects through a variety of services, including a team of science and engineering librarians, technological tools, and access to research collections in engineering, mathematics, physics, statistics, Earth and planetary sciences, psychology, and cross-disciplinary studies. “Cabot Library is positioned to be at the forefront of science libraries,” said Sarah E. Thomas, vice president for the Harvard Library and University Librarian, and Roy E. Larsen Librarian for FAS. “It is designed to inspire the students, faculty, and staff of Harvard University to experiment, collaborate, and share new ideas.” Aligned with the goals of Harvard’s Common Spaces initiative, the library combines traditional library features — books, computers, and quiet common areas — “with flexible spaces and creative services to transform the way in which the library meets the evolving needs of science and engineering research and education,” said Thomas. Part of the goal of the renovation was to reinvigorate the Cabot Science Library as a place that serves the present and future needs of both the disciplines housed in the library, as well as the needs of the campus at large. Enhancements were made to link the library with the whole of the entry area and ground floor of the building to create a deep sense of connection between the social aspect of the Science Center and the study and research offerings of the library. “The College hopes this new space can foster student-led programming such as social events, support creative collaborations with library staff, and serve as an environment in which students can connect informally with their peers, faculty, and staff,” said David Friedrich, associate dean of students at Harvard College. Designed by Mack Scogin, Kajima Professor in Practice of Architecture and former chairman of the Harvard Department of Architecture, and his partner, Merrill Elam, many of the walls and surfaces are white or glass. Added pops of color in the furnishings throughout lend the streamlined space a liveliness that gives students and scholars a vibrant setting for study and play. “The now transparent and open architecture at Cabot Library recognizes a thoughtful evolution of learning and teaching that is more social and collective,” said Scogin. “It is a hybrid learning experience arising from both the classroom and the library that sacrifices none of the intensity of either.” At the main entrance to Cabot, users will find that renovations have made the library a visibly vital part of the building. Once inside, glass walls surround, offering a glimpse into the library. A ramp sets off a large projection screen, which has the ability to showcase scientific scholarship and library resources. It also displays a social space, with the café bridging the main corridor and the space of the library. Cabot’s first floor is open, colorful, and high-tech — a space that has the feel of an upscale café designed for conversation and collaboration. The main passageway of the building is now well-lit and spacious, and users can see through the building into the central courtyard. An exciting feature of the library is the Discovery Bar, which anchors a flexible presentation and exploration space that will host a variety of programs. Here, students can participate in demonstrations at the bar, or take part in larger programming that utilizes the open space nearby. Harvard community members can grab a bite to eat and coffee at Clover Food Lab, and can choose to settle in at one of the numerous tables or comfy chairs in the nearby café space or to enjoy the newly designed courtyard, which extends study and social spaces to the outside. Students will find myriad environments for academic or social time, supported by integrated learning resources and a dedicated research staff. Cabot Library’s lower level is equally bright thanks to the building’s open floor plan, and supports new media, group study, course reserves, and collections. This floor features some of the library’s most advanced technology, including two new media studios where users can create and edit their own videos and multimedia, and a new flexible instruction room next door. Building on the success of Lamont B30, Harvard Hall 202, and other active-learning classrooms, the instruction room includes multiple projectors, video cameras, and an overhead camera. Instructors have the ability to present from laptops and cellphones, and students can project work from their individual tables to several video-carts. With a capacity of 24, the room’s glass wall can easily be pulled aside to open into an overflow area. The lower level also offers seven group study rooms, featuring large monitors and writable walls. Users on this floor can facilitate video conferencing or interviews in three personal chat booths. For the first time, undergraduate students will be able to reserve study rooms on their own, using Roombook — a reservation system used on campus. Faculty, graduate students, and staff are welcome to use the spaces, though library staff will mediate their requests. Jeffrey Schnapp, faculty director of the metaLAB at Harvard and chair of the faculty committee that directed the renovations, shared a unique perspective on the opportunities this renovation provided members of the Harvard community. “We paid particular attention to answering the question of what a science library could or should be in the 21st century,” said Schnapp. “The new Cabot Science Library is now one of the nodes in the disciplinary universe that makes Harvard such a rich place to inhabit, one characterized not by crowds elbowing their way through the main hallways, but rather by the feeling that one is entering into a pleasurable, sensorially rich, multidisciplinary community where one wants to slow down, linger, hang out.” This transformation of the Science Center atrium and Cabot Science Library was made possible by a generous gift from Bryan Traubert and Penny Pritzker ’81, as part of the Campaign for Arts and Sciences. “We are very proud to honor my parents at their beloved alma mater by making a significant improvement to the quality of the student experience,” said Pritzker.

Title: Cabot Library, re-imagined

Re-imagining Cabot Library will bridge modern scholarship with the library’s traditional collections, and lead the way for increased cross-disciplinary cooperation to support the innovative teaching and collaborative learning of tech-savvy undergraduates. File photos by Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer The Science Center atrium and Cabot Science Library , already filled with bustling undergraduates, will undergo a transformation to support learning and teaching for the digital age while more effectively connecting the library to the atrium and plaza social spaces. The redesign will support student life and align with the goals of Harvard’s Common Spaces initiative. “The Cabot Science Library is ripe for re-imagining, and its prime location in the heart of the Science Center offers an opportunity to serve as an undergraduate teaching, learning, and research support hub for all the disciplines now requiring digital resources,” said Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). The library serves as Harvard’s general science library, with emphasis on research collections in mathematics, statistics, earth and planetary sciences, psychology, and cross-disciplinary studies. In announcing the renovation, Smith said a faculty committee will be formed to provide input throughout the construction process. In addition, feedback from students and staff will help guide the project. “To ensure that we make the most of this opportunity, the re-imagining of the library must be done thoughtfully, with input from faculty with a keen interest in undergraduate education, and from undergraduates themselves,” Smith said. “How to meaningfully weave together information and space?” asked Jeffrey Schnapp, faculty director of the metaLAB at Harvard and chair of the faculty committee that will direct the renovations. “Traditional library structures have done this for tens of centuries, but in the midst of a media revolution comparable to the passage from scrolls to codices and manuscripts to print, we have the opportunity to model new visions of the library for the digital age. I see this as the core charge for the Cabot Science Library committee.” This transformation of the Science Center atrium and Cabot Science Library is being sponsored by a generous gift. “Science libraries are important spaces for collaboration, consultation, and community building, connecting people and information in service of creativity and discovery,” observed Sarah Thomas , Roy E. Larsen Librarian for FAS and vice president for the Harvard Library. “Cabot Library is heavily used by undergraduates, not just science concentrators, but students from across the disciplines,” said Susan Fliss, associate librarian of Harvard College for research, teaching, and learning. “The process of designing the Cabot Library with input from a range of users allows us to better plan our integrated service offerings in cooperation with other academic support partners such as the Academic Technology Group, the Bok Center, and HUIT,” which stands for Harvard University Information Technology. The renovation will include an examination of the library’s relationship to existing and future programs in the Science Center, possibly including a visualization lab and a digital media research commons. The programs are being designed to strengthen technology-based teaching, learning, and collaboration across disciplines from the sciences to the humanities. The project will redesign the atrium, which will enhance this central and highly utilized social space. “Cabot Library has long served a vital role in providing access for our students and faculty to the journals and other works necessary for their scholarship. But technological advances have now changed the ways in which we access and use these materials, providing an opportunity to rethink how we use Cabot and the Science Center,” said Jeremy Bloxham, dean of the FAS Division of Science. “We envisage a center for technology-based learning that will allow our students and faculty to take full advantage of the digital resources that new technologies provide, not just for the sciences, but for scholarship in and across all areas of academic inquiry.” Re-imagining Cabot will bridge modern scholarship with the library’s traditional collections, and lead the way for increased cross-disciplinary cooperation to support the innovative teaching and collaborative learning of tech-savvy undergraduates. Lynne Schmelz, librarian of the Cabot Science Library, added, “The timing couldn’t be better for us to join forces to conceptualize the new Cabot Library. We are indeed fortunate that a generous gift will help us realize a 21st-century Cabot Library that supports integrated services and collections.” The Science Center sits at the crossroads of Harvard Yard and the northern part of the campus. With its entrance just off the center’s busy atrium, the library is well-suited to be a social center and innovative learning and teaching space. Cabot is also adjacent to the recently renovated Science Center Plaza, a popular area in the Common Spaces project that succeeded in bringing together students, faculty, and staff from across the University. The plaza has a weekly farmers market and will host dozens of local artists and designers from Boston’s SoWa Open Market over the next several Fridays. FAS planning committees are in the process of selecting an architect, who will work closely with faculty and library staff as the project progresses.

Title: Lights, camera, Cabot

Kaitlin Buckley Harvard Library Communications In the next four years, today’s freshmen will spend about 2 million minutes at Harvard, and precisely where to devote them can be overwhelming. They can get a little help with that decision at the Cabot Science Library. There, sophomores Rosan Bishwakarma and Lucas Ward created a new podcast that shares graduating seniors’ stories, advice, and insights on everything from writing a thesis on Beyoncé to balancing athletics and academics to graduating early to getting involved in a political campaign. The casual and collaborative approach helps freshmen make sense of Harvard’s many resources. Bishwakarma and Ward conceived of the podcast over a chance conversation at lunch in Annenberg Hall. Their wanted to talk to graduating seniors about their experiences before they left; in Bishwakarma’s words, “to capture all these different sides of Harvard and share it.” Coincidentally, they next walked through Cabot and saw one of their friends in the media studios. They were off and running with their idea: connecting with library staff, learning how to use the equipment, and scheduling guests. After that, “It was just about hitting record and having a good conversation,” Ward said. The multimedia studios sit past the library’s glass-walled study rooms. Each has a green screen, microphones, lighting board, and camera, everything but the imagination and flash drive needed to bring tangible form to students’ ideas. “Students have a million ideas,” said Paul Worster, a multimodal learning librarian who helps run the studio. After a brief orientation with the space and equipment, anyone in the Harvard community can reserve to produce their own creative work, and extra help is available from librarians and student employees next to the Macs used as editing bays. Podcast recording is just one way to use the new space. Other projects on deck include TED-style talks for a psychology class, instructional videos on 3-D scanning, and a children’s educational show using puppets as teaching tools. The studios encourage both collaboration and learning. “We want to empower [students] to be creative on their own with the tools they have,” said Susan Berstler, a technology specialist involved in the studio. The Cabot team enjoys “when the lightbulb goes on and students take ownership of their ideas,” she said. “If you have an idea, there are so many talented people willing to help and support you,” Bishwakarma said. “Try it out. The worst thing that can happen is you learn something.” To reserve space in the studios, please email cabcirc@fas.harvard.edu .
