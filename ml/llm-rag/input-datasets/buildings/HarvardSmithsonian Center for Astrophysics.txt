The Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian ( CfA ), previously known as the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , is an astrophysics research institute jointly operated by the Harvard College Observatory and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory . Founded in 1973 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts , United States, the CfA leads a broad program of research in astronomy , astrophysics , Earth and space sciences , as well as science education . The CfA either leads or participates in the development and operations of more than fifteen ground- and space-based astronomical research observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum , including the forthcoming Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory , one of NASA 's Great Observatories . Hosting more than 850 scientists, engineers, and support staff, the CfA is among the largest astronomical research institutes in the world. Its projects have included Nobel Prize-winning advances in cosmology and high energy astrophysics , the discovery of many exoplanets , and the first image of a black hole . The CfA also serves a major role in the global astrophysics research community : the CfA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS), for example, has been universally adopted as the world's online database of astronomy and physics papers. Known for most of its history as the "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics", the CfA rebranded in 2018 to its current name in an effort to reflect its unique status as a joint collaboration between Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution . Lisa Kewley has served as the director of the CfA since 2022. The Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian is not formally an independent legal organization, but rather an institutional entity operated under a memorandum of understanding between Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution . This collaboration was formalized on July 1, 1973, with the goal of coordinating the related research activities of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) under the leadership of a single director, and housed within the same complex of buildings on the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts . The CfA's history is therefore also that of the two fully independent organizations that comprise it. With a combined history of more than 300 years, HCO and SAO have been host to major milestones in astronomical history that predate the CfA's founding. These are briefly summarized below. Samuel Pierpont Langley , the third Secretary of the Smithsonian , founded the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory on the south yard of the Smithsonian Castle (on the U.S. National Mall ) on March 1, 1890. The Astrophysical Observatory's initial, primary purpose was to "record the amount and character of the Sun's heat". Charles Greeley Abbot was named SAO's first director, and the observatory operated solar telescopes to take daily measurements of the Sun 's intensity in different regions of the optical electromagnetic spectrum . In doing so, the observatory enabled Abbot to make critical refinements to the Solar constant , as well as to serendipitously discover Solar variability . It is likely that SAO's early history as a solar observatory was part of the inspiration behind the Smithsonian's "sunburst" logo, designed in 1965 by Crimilda Pontes . In 1955, the scientific headquarters of SAO moved from Washington, D.C. to Cambridge, Massachusetts , to affiliate with the Harvard College Observatory (HCO). Fred Lawrence Whipple , then the chairman of the Harvard Astronomy Department, was named the new director of SAO. The collaborative relationship between SAO and HCO therefore predates the official creation of the CfA by 18 years. SAO's move to Harvard's campus also resulted in a rapid expansion of its research program. Following the launch of Sputnik (the world's first human-made satellite) in 1957, SAO accepted a national challenge to create a worldwide satellite-tracking network, collaborating with the United States Air Force on Project Space Track . With the creation of NASA the following year and throughout the Space Race , SAO led major efforts in the development of orbiting observatories and large ground-based telescopes , laboratory and theoretical astrophysics , as well as the application of computers to astrophysical problems. Partly in response to renewed public interest in astronomy following the 1835 return of Halley's Comet , the Harvard College Observatory was founded in 1839, when the Harvard Corporation appointed William Cranch Bond as an "Astronomical Observer to the University". For its first four years of operation, the observatory was situated at the Dana-Palmer House (where Bond also resided) near Harvard Yard , and consisted of little more than three small telescopes and an astronomical clock. In his 1840 book recounting the history of the college, then Harvard President Josiah Quincy III noted that "there is wanted a reflecting telescope equatorially mounted". This telescope, the 15-inch "Great Refractor", opened seven years later (in 1847) at the top of Observatory Hill in Cambridge (where it still exists today, housed in the oldest of the CfA's complex of buildings). The telescope was the largest in the United States from 1847 until 1867. William Bond and pioneer photographer John Adams Whipple used the Great Refractor to produce the first clear Daguerrotypes of the Moon (winning them an award at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London). Bond and his son, George Phillips Bond (the second director of HCO), used it to discover Saturn's 8th moon, Hyperion (which was also independently discovered by William Lassell ). Under the directorship of Edward Charles Pickering from 1877 to 1919, the observatory became the world's major producer of stellar spectra and magnitudes, established an observing station in Peru , and applied mass-production methods to the analysis of data . It was during this time that HCO became host to a series of major discoveries in astronomical history , powered by the observatory's so-called " Computers " (women hired by Pickering as skilled workers to process astronomical data). These "Computers" included Williamina Fleming , Annie Jump Cannon , Henrietta Swan Leavitt , Florence Cushman and Antonia Maury , all widely recognized today as major figures in scientific history . Henrietta Swan Leavitt , for example, discovered the so-called period-luminosity relation for Classical Cepheid variable stars , establishing the first major " standard candle " with which to measure the distance to galaxies . Now called " Leavitt's law ", the discovery is regarded as one of the most foundational and important in the history of astronomy ; astronomers like Edwin Hubble , for example, would later use Leavitt's law to establish that the Universe is expanding , the primary piece of evidence for the Big Bang model . Upon Pickering's retirement in 1921, the directorship of HCO fell to Harlow Shapley (a major participant in the so-called " Great Debate " of 1920). This era of the observatory was made famous by the work of Cecelia Payne-Gaposchkin , who became the first woman to earn a PhD in astronomy from Radcliffe College (a short walk from the observatory). Payne-Gapochkin's 1925 thesis proposed that stars were composed primarily of hydrogen and helium , an idea thought ridiculous at the time. Between Shapley's tenure and the formation of the CfA, the observatory was directed by Donald H. Menzel and then Leo Goldberg , both of whom maintained widely recognized programs in solar and stellar astrophysics. Menzel played a major role in encouraging the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to move to Cambridge and collaborate more closely with HCO. The collaborative foundation for what would ultimately give rise to the Center for Astrophysics began with SAO's move to Cambridge in 1955. Fred Whipple , who was already chair of the Harvard Astronomy Department (housed within HCO since 1931 ), was named SAO's new director at the start of this new era; an early test of the model for a unified directorship across HCO and SAO. The following 18 years would see the two independent entities merge ever closer together, operating effectively (but informally) as one large research center. This joint relationship was formalized as the new Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics on July 1, 1973. George B. Field , then affiliated with Berkeley , was appointed as its first director. That same year, a new astronomical journal , the CfA Preprint Series was created, and a CfA/SAO instrument flying aboard Skylab discovered coronal holes on the Sun. The founding of the CfA also coincided with the birth of X-ray astronomy as a new, major field that was largely dominated by CfA scientists in its early years. Riccardo Giacconi , regarded as the "father of X-ray astronomy", founded the High Energy Astrophysics Division within the new CfA by moving most of his research group (then at American Sciences and Engineering ) to SAO in 1973. That group would later go on to launch the Einstein Observatory (the first imaging X-ray telescope ) in 1976, and ultimately lead the proposals and development of what would become the Chandra X-ray Observatory . Chandra, the second of NASA's Great Observatories and still the most powerful X-ray telescope in history, continues operations today as part of the CfA's Chandra X-ray Center. Giacconi would later win the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics for his foundational work in X-ray astronomy. Shortly after the launch of the Einstein Observatory , the CfA's Steven Weinberg won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on electroweak unification . The following decade saw the start of the landmark CfA Redshift Survey (the first attempt to map the large scale structure of the Universe ), as well as the release of the "Field Report", a highly influential Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey chaired by the outgoing CfA Director George Field . He would be replaced in 1982 by Irwin Shapiro , who during his tenure as director (1982 to 2004) oversaw the expansion of the CfA's observing facilities around the world, including the newly named Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory , the Infrared Telescope (IRT) aboard the Space Shuttle , the 6.5-meter Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT), the SOHO satellite , and the launch of Chandra in 1999. CfA-led discoveries throughout this period include canonical work on Supernova 1987A , the " CfA2 Great Wall " (then the largest known coherent structure in the Universe), the best-yet evidence for supermassive black holes , and the first convincing evidence for an extrasolar planet . The 1980s also saw the CfA play a distinct role in the history of computer science and the internet: in 1986, SAO started developing SAOImage, one of the world's first X11 -based applications made publicly available (its successor, DS9, remains the most widely used astronomical FITS image viewer worldwide). During this time, scientists and software developers at the CfA also began work on what would become the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), one of the world's first online databases of research papers . By 1993, the ADS was running the first routine transatlantic queries between databases, a foundational aspect of the internet today. Charles Alcock , known for a number of major works related to massive compact halo objects , was named the third director of the CfA in 2004. Today Alcock oversees one of the largest and most productive astronomical institutes in the world, with more than 850 staff and an annual budget in excess of $100 million. The Harvard Department of Astronomy, housed within the CfA, maintains a continual complement of approximately 60 PhD students , more than 100 postdoctoral researchers , and roughly 25 undergraduate astronomy and astrophysics majors from Harvard College . SAO, meanwhile, hosts a long-running and highly rated REU Summer Intern program as well as many visiting graduate students. The CfA estimates that roughly 10% of the professional astrophysics community in the United States spent at least a portion of their career or education there. The CfA is either a lead or major partner in the operations of the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory , the Submillimeter Array , MMT Observatory , the South Pole Telescope , VERITAS , and a number of other smaller ground-based telescopes . The CfA's 2019–2024 Strategic Plan includes the construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope as a driving priority for the center. Along with the Chandra X-ray Observatory , the CfA plays a central role in a number of space-based observing facilities , including the recently launched Parker Solar Probe , Kepler space telescope , the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) , and Hinode . The CfA, via the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, recently played a major role in the Lynx X-ray Observatory , a NASA-funded large mission concept study commissioned as part of the 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey ("Astro2020"). If launched, Lynx would be the most powerful X-ray observatory constructed to date, enabling order-of-magnitude advances in capability over Chandra. SAO is one of the 13 stakeholder institutes for the Event Horizon Telescope Board, and the CfA hosts its Array Operations Center. In 2019, the project revealed the first direct image of a black hole. The result is widely regarded as a triumph not only of observational astronomy , but of its intersection with theoretical astrophysics . Union of the observational and theoretical subfields of astrophysics has been a major focus of the CfA since its founding. In 2018, the CfA rebranded , changing its official name to the "Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian" in an effort to reflect its unique status as a joint collaboration between Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution . Today, the CfA receives roughly 70% of its funding from NASA , 22% from Smithsonian federal funds, and 4% from the National Science Foundation . The remaining 4% comes from contributors including the United States Department of Energy , the Annenberg Foundation , as well as other gifts and endowments. Research across the CfA is organized into six divisions and seven research centers: The CfA is also host to the Harvard University Department of Astronomy, large central engineering and computation facilities, the Science Education Department, the John G. Wolbach Library, the world's largest database of astronomy and physics papers (ADS) , and the world's largest collection of astronomical photographic plates. 42°22′53″N 71°07′42″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.38146°N 71.12837°W ﻿ / 42.38146; -71.12837

Illustration courtesy of CfA Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics In our solar system, only one planet is blessed with an ocean: Earth. Our home world is a rare, blue jewel compared with the deserts of Mercury, Venus, and Mars. But what if our sun had not one but two habitable ocean worlds? Astronomers have found such a planetary system orbiting the star Kepler-62. This five-planet system has two worlds in the habitable zone — the distance from their star at which they receive enough light and warmth that liquid water could theoretically exist on their surfaces. Modeling by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) suggests that both planets are water worlds, their surfaces completely covered by a global ocean with no land in sight. “These planets are unlike anything in our solar system. They have endless oceans,” said lead author Lisa Kaltenegger of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and the CfA. “There may be life there, but could it be technology-based like ours? Life on these worlds would be under water with no easy access to metals, to electricity, or fire for metallurgy. Nonetheless, these worlds will still be beautiful, blue planets circling an orange star — and maybe life’s inventiveness to get to a technology stage will surprise us.” Kepler-62 is a type K star slightly smaller and cooler than our sun. The two water worlds, designated Kepler-62e and -62f, orbit the star every 122 and 267 days, respectively. They were found by NASA’s Kepler spacecraft, which detects planets that transit, or cross the face of, their host star. Measuring a transit tells astronomers the size of the planet relative to its star. Kepler-62e is 60 percent larger than Earth, while Kepler-62f is about 40 percent larger, making both of them “super-Earths.” They are too small for their masses to be measured, but astronomers expect them to be composed of rock and water, without a significant gaseous envelope. As the warmer of the two worlds, Kepler-62e would have a bit more clouds than Earth, according to computer models. More distant Kepler-62f would need the greenhouse effect from plenty of carbon dioxide to warm it enough to host an ocean. Otherwise, it might become an ice-covered snowball. “Kepler-62e probably has a very cloudy sky and is warm and humid all the way to the polar regions. Kepler-62f would be cooler, but still potentially life-friendly,” said Harvard astronomer and co-author Dimitar Sasselov . “The good news is — the two would exhibit distinctly different colors and make our search for signatures of life easier on such planets in the near future,” he added. The discovery raises the intriguing possibility that some star in our galaxy might be circled by two Earth-like worlds — planets with oceans and continents, where technologically advanced life could develop. “Imagine looking through a telescope to see another world with life just a few million miles from your own. Or, having the capability to travel between them on a regular basis. I can’t think of a more powerful motivation to become a space-faring society,” said Sasselov. Kaltenegger and Sasselov’s research has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal .

Title: First image of black hole at the heart of Milky Way

First image of Sagittarius A* (or Sgr A* for short), the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. EHT Collaboration Juan Siliezar Harvard Staff Writer An international team of astronomers led by scientists at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian who produced the first direct image of a black hole three years ago have now produced a portrait of a second, this time a much-anticipated glimpse of one at the heart of the Milky Way . The new picture was captured by researchers from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration who unveiled their first image in 2019. The group targeted both black holes at the outset but focused their attention on one at a time, owing to a difference in the complexity of the two projects. “This is our supermassive black hole,” said Peter Galison, director of Harvard’s Black Hole Initiative, a member of the EHT team, and the Joseph Pellegrino University Professor in the History of Science and Physics. “This is at the center of where we live.” The image of this object known as Sagittarius A-star, often referred to as Sgr A* (pronounced sadge-ay-star), shows the telltale sign of a black hole, as did the earlier one in the Messier 87 galaxy (M87): a bright ring of superhot glowing material circling a dark center so dense and bottomless that not even light can escape. The way the light bends around the dark center, known as the event horizon, shows the object’s powerful gravity, which is four million times that of our sun. The new picture, described today in a special issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters, provides the first direct visual evidence that the giant lurking 27,000 light-years away at the center of Earth’s galaxy is, in fact, a supermassive black hole. It also bolsters theories of where these cosmic monsters exist and may help to explain how galaxies are formed. Simulations comparing M87 with SgrA* show how much faster material moving at the speed of light orbits SgrA* because of its smaller size. Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian “Having seen this bright ring around the darkness of a black hole once was astonishing, but having now seen it twice, we begin to really have confidence of what we’re seeing and that at the center of galaxies there are these enormous black holes that are millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun,” Galison said. Members of the EHT project unveiled the picture at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., shortly after 9 a.m. EST, in sync with six other news conferences in cities around the world. At the press conference in D.C., Michael Johnson, an astrophysicist at the CfA and a leading member of the EHT said one of the key lessons from the project was that the black hole at the center of the Milky Way doesn’t appear to be pulling in as much material as others, making the environment more relatively stable. Members of Harvard’s Black Hole Initiative meet to discuss the first-ever image of Sagittarius A*. Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian “While M87 had one of the biggest black holes in the universe and it launches a jet that pierces its entire galaxy, Sgr A* is giving us a view into the much more standard state of black holes, quiet and quiescent,” said Johnson. NASA Einstein Fellow at the CfA Sara Issaoun worked on observations and imaging for the EHT team and discussed the image at the European press conference in Germany. She said the new image reveals some key details about the black hole that were previously unknown, including that one side of the black hole is almost directly facing Earth. “These properties, this knowledge of the fundamental properties of the black hole will help us study the astrophysics of the black hole in more detail later on,” Issaoun said. Issaoun also pointed out that the new view further cements Einstein’s theories on gravity and relativity. “The cool thing about Sgr A* is that we know its mass with great accuracy so we know exactly what Einstein’s theory of relativity should predict for how big the shadow in the center should be — around 50 micro-arcseconds in angular size or 60 million kilometers across,” Issaoun said. “That is what we’ve measured in our image.” The black hole images were captured with the Event Horizon Telescope, a worldwide network, including this array from Hilo, Hawaii, that link together to form a single Earth-sized virtual instrument. Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian The researchers produced the picture with observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, a worldwide network of radio telescopes that link together to form a single Earth-sized virtual instrument. In April 2017, eight radio observatories on six mountains on four continents stared on and off at a pair of black holes for 10 days — Sgr A* and a second that lies at the heart of the elliptical galaxy M87. From that observation data, which was then crunched by supercomputer algorithms, came the image of the M87 black hole as well as the one just released. The two images can now be compared to gain valuable insight on the inner workings of these supermassive giants and how they interact with their surroundings, a process thought to play a key role in shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies. M87 is 55 million light-years away in the Virgo Galaxy cluster and has a mass about 6.5 billion times that of our sun. The bright circle of gas and dust that collects and swirls around it is known as an accretion disk. It takes many days to orbit around this gargantuan object. That means that when the EHT team shines their telescopes on it for hours — using a technique called very long baseline interferometry that works like taking a long exposure image on a camera — any change appears very gradually. Sgr A*, on the other hand, is on the small side. If it was the size of a doughnut, M87 would be the size of a football stadium, Issaoun said at the press conference in Germany. This means superheated gas, which travels at near-light speed and takes days to orbit M87, only takes minutes to orbit Sgr A*, which is why there is so much motion blur in the image. “The analogy would be if you have an adult getting their portrait taken with a long exposure, and they’re just sitting still. That’s M87,” Issaoun said. “For Sgr A*, you have a toddler running around and you’re trying to get their portrait with the long-exposure camera. You’re just going to get a bunch of blur everywhere.” In addition, there is a giant cloud of ionized gas between Earth and the Galactic Center, which distorts the images the EHT takes of Sgr A,* which sits in central region of the Milky Way. “We’re looking at our own Galactic Center through an interstellar soup of all the dust and gas between us,” said Daniel Palumbo, a Harvard graduate student at the CfA who worked on the data analysis. “This material scatters the light that we observe from Sgr A*. It’s like looking at something through frosted glass.” “This is our supermassive black hole. This is at the center of where we live.” Seeing all these difficulties, the Event Horizon team first focused on the M87 data before turning their full attention to that of Sgr A*. In the end, the researchers were able to produce their final image, which isn’t just one picture but the average of thousands of images created using different computational methods to account for the movement of the gas. The individual images showed many different structures that highlighted the uncertainty in the computational methods from the rapidly changing appearance of Sgr A*, including all the movement and plasma flares that go with it. The averaged image retains features more commonly seen in the varied images and suppresses features that appeared less frequently. “We wanted to know how to measure the structure of the ring from all these possible images,” said Razieh Emami, a postdoctoral researcher at the CfA who made precise measurements of the ring and worked to combine data from multiple nights of observations into the single final image released Thursday. That there now exist images of two black holes of very different sizes is particularly exciting to the astronomers, and they have already begun to use the new data to test theories and models of how gas behaves around supermassive black holes. It also marks a monumental collaborative achievement for the EHT, made up of more than 300 researchers from 80 institutes around the globe and 11 observatories. “The analogy would be if you have an adult getting their portrait taken with a long exposure, and they’re just sitting still. That’s M87. For Sgr A*, you have a toddler running around … You’re just going to get a bunch of blur everywhere.” Much of the work is based on the Harvard campus with dozens of astronomers, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates at the Black Hole Initiative and CfA. “With the interdisciplinary expertise at the Smithsonian, Harvard, and the Center for Astrophysics, our large group here has become the center of gravity for this visionary project, and an incubator for discoveries over the next decade,” said CfA scientist Sheperd Doeleman, founding director of the EHT and co-director of the Black Hole Initiative. The work of studying these giants is far from finished. The members of the group say they are now looking at a next-generation EHT (ngEHT) project: capturing video of a black hole. The project will involve designing new ultra-high-speed instrumentation and a plan to double the number of radio dishes in the EHT array that will allow scientists “to create an Earth-sized motion picture camera” that “will bring black holes to vibrant life,” said Doeleman, who also leads the ngEHT project. “We know that there’s more to see here,” Johnson said. “We know that there are sharp features that are that are tight predictions from general relativity. This is how we can push our theories further. We’re hoping to add these new telescopes around the world and be able to really dig into those sharp features and to be able to see these high-resolution movies.” A separate panel of CfA scientists will participate in a public Q&A panel at 3 p.m. EDT today which will be livestreamed on the CfA’s Facebook and YouTube pages. On Monday at 5:15 p.m. in the Harvard Science Center, Hall C, there will be a special public event with members of Harvard’s EHT team discussing the results.
