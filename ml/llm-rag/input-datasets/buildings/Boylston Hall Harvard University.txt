Boylston Hall is a Harvard University classroom and academic office building lecture hall near the southwest corner of Harvard Yard , Cambridge, Massachusetts . Ward Nicholas Boylston had left a bequest to Harvard for the building in 1828. It was built in 1858 to designs in Rundbogenstil by Paul Schulze of Schulze and Schoen. It was clad in stone, as specified by the donor, specifically Rockport granite, and had a hip roof . In 1871, Peabody and Stearns replaced the roof with a mansarded third floor. It has been speculated that it stands on the homesite of the Rev. Thomas Hooker , first minister to the first church in Cambridge , but this is not well established. It originally served as a chemistry building, with a laboratory and classrooms, and later housed the anatomical museum of Jeffries Wyman , Professor of Comparative Anatomy, who in 1866 became the first curator of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology , as well as a mineralogical collection. In the 20th century, it became the first home of the Harvard-Yenching Institute . Boylston Hall was gut renovated in 1959 by the architectural firm of Benjamin Thompson and Associates , and is considered an early example of the reuse of sound old buildings (" adaptive reconstruction "), "juxtaposing glass and steel with historic details". It functioned as the university language center. It houses the offices of the Harvard Classics Department. Its Fong Lecture Hall seats 144. 42°22′24″N 71°07′02″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.373332°N 71.117327°W ﻿ / 42.373332; -71.117327

The journey was a long one, indeed. The Class of 2013 arrived in 2009 eager, wild-eyed, and excited — and four years later, they would leave just the same way. There was Commencement speaker Oprah — Oprah! — ushering them into a new chapter, urging Harvard’s latest graduates to “max out” their humanity. There were friends and families cheering and snapping pictures from their seats in Tercentenary Theatre. There were cries, certainly, but cries of joy. With new degrees in hand, it was all over, and it was all worth it.

Title: When the sky turned black

Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns showed clips from his latest film, “The Dust Bowl,” and fielded questions from the audience at Boylston Hall on Wednesday. The event was moderated by Robin Kelsey, the Shirley Carter Burden Professor of Photography and chair of the Department of the History of Art and Architecture. Photos by Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer Alvin Powell Harvard Staff Writer Ken Burns’ cutting-room floor must be a horrible thing to behold. Burns , the acclaimed documentary filmmaker, outlined a philosophy for making films that includes ruthless cutting and a conviction that making the best overall film sometimes means slashing even great scenes if, for one reason or another, they slow the story flow. He told a story during an appearance at Harvard Wednesday about the making of a documentary on Mark Twain that included a scene from Twain’s “Life on the Mississippi,” showing his sleepy hometown of Hannibal, Mo., perking to life with the arrival of a riverboat and then falling back into slumber after the boat leaves. The scene was good, but Burns felt that the film dragged a bit later on, fatiguing viewers. Burns traced the fatigue to that scene, observing that the flat element isn’t always where its effect is felt. “It was a great, great scene, but it had to go,” Burns said. “You’ve heard about the cutting-room floor. It’s not filled with anything that is bad. It’s all good stuff, and sometimes stuff that is better than any particular moment that you might be able to isolate in the final film.” Burns showed clips from his latest film, “ The Dust Bowl ,” and fielded questions from the audience at Boylston Hall on Wednesday. The event, sponsored by the Harvard University Center for the Environment , was moderated by Robin Kelsey, the Shirley Carter Burden Professor of Photography and chair of the Department of the History of Art and Architecture . Burns’ latest documentary chronicles the environmental disaster that struck the Great Plains in the 1930s. It was caused by a severe drought, aggravated by decades of poor agricultural practices during which the deep-rooted, soil-holding native grasses had been turned over and replaced by agricultural crops. The four-hour, two-part film, which premieres Nov. 18 and 19 on public television, includes interviews with more than two dozen Dust Bowl survivors, who tell of storms so dense that they blacked out the sun and raged for hours and even days. The grit was carried on winds that blew so hard it could damage eyes, and it was so fine that it got into everything, including mouths and lungs, where it could kill by causing pneumonia. Analysts featured in the film called the Dust Bowl one of the largest human-created environmental disasters in U.S. history. Those who lived through it said it is impossible to exaggerate its harshness. The 40- to 60-mile-per-hour winds created “black blizzards” that struck 14 times in 1932 and 38 times in 1933. One witness described it as “two midnights in a jug.” Unable to grow food, farmers abandoned their fields. Through the course of the disaster, rural counties lost sizable parts of their population, with Morton County, Kan., faring among the worst, losing nearly half. The biggest challenge in making the documentary, Burns said, was finding people who had lived through the Dust Bowl storms. The researchers eventually found 29 people whom they could interview, 26 of whom made it into the final version. Those interviews were augmented with hundreds of archival sources, photographs, and interviews with experts who’ve studied the era. The research and production of the film had an urgency because of the advanced age of those who lived through the ’30s. About half of those who were filmed have since died, Burns said. The filmmaking process described by Burns includes constant revision, rewriting, and research that occurs throughout the process. He also treats music as a central part of the film. Rather than tacking it on at the end, it gets put in place first to help dictate pacing and rhythm. The filmmaking planning extends a decade into the future, Burns said, with future films in the offing on the Central Park Five, the Roosevelts, Vietnam, and Jackie Robinson. “I’ve always said that if I were given 1,000 years to live, I wouldn’t run out of topics in American history,” Burns said.

Individuals with albinism face discrimination in societies around the world. Reports of attacks and mutilation occur daily, with thousands of albinos living under threat or at risk. The Harvard Foundation will host a panel discussion and photo exhibition, “Prejudice and Violence against People with Albinism: An International Concern,” on Thu., Oct. 28, and Fri., Oct. 29, to bring attention to this worldwide issue. The panel discussion will be taped and made available to other colleges and organizations around the world. “The Harvard Foundation is pleased to conduct a program on prejudice and violence against albinos,” said S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation. “It is one of the last unchallenged and unattended prejudices on earth, and we hope to enlightenment people about this bias and mistreatment, and bring about greater understanding and protection of persons with albinism. We are pleased that our students with albinism are taking an active part in this important program.” The panel discussion will take place on Thu., Oct. 28, at 5:30 p.m. in Fong Auditorium, Boylston Hall, in Harvard Yard. Rick Guidotti’s photos of persons with albinism from around the world will be on display in the Harvard University Science Center Arcade on Oct. 28 and 29. Both events are free and open to the public.
