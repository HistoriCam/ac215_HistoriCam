Harvard Library is the network of libraries and services at Harvard University , a private Ivy League university in Cambridge, Massachusetts . Harvard Library is the oldest library system in the United States and both the largest academic library and largest private library in the world. Its collection holds over 20 million volumes, 400 million manuscripts, 10 million photographs, and one million maps. Harvard Library holds the third-largest collection of all libraries in the world, after the Library of Congress and Boston Public Library , by number of volumes held. Among libraries, measured on the number of all items held, it is the fifth-largest library in the nation. Harvard Library is a member of the Research Collections and Preservation Consortium (ReCAP); other members include Columbia University Libraries , Princeton University Library , New York Public Library , and Ivy Plus Libraries Confederation, making over 90 million books available to the library's users. The library is open to current Harvard affiliates, and some events and spaces are open to the public. The largest and most recognized building in the Harvard Library system is Widener Library in Harvard Yard . Harvard 's library system grew primarily from personal donations, including from John Harvard and John Hull . John Harvard was a Puritan minister who accumulated 400 books spreading word of his faith. These volumes were left to Harvard, initiating the library's collection. The works in this collection soon became obsolete, as Harvard Library quickly changed to an academic institute and found little need for the theological titles. Until 1676, the library was based in Old College building. That year, it moved to Harvard Hall , where it remained until 1764. By 1764 it was the largest library in British America, with 5,000 volumes, but disaster struck that year when the library was destroyed by fire. A new Harvard Hall was built, and 15,000 books were collected to create the new library. After the fire, readers in the library were not allowed candles or lamps and if there was a fire burning in the hearth, a librarian or assistant had to be present. Harvard patrons were allowed to borrow and return up to three books at a time on Friday mornings and were allowed to keep them for up to six weeks. Thomas Hollis V , great-nephew of one of the university's early benefactors, began shipping thousands of specially chosen volumes to the library. Hollis continued to send books regularly until his death in 1774, and he bequeathed £500 for the university to continue acquiring books. This became Harvard's first endowed book fund, and the fund has grown annually since. Harvard Library's online catalog , HOLLIS, a backronym for " H arvard O n- L ine L ibrary I nformation S ystem", is named after him. In 1841, with space limited in Harvard Hall, the library was moved to Gore Hall in 1841. In 1912, the library moved again after Gore Hall became unsuitable, and the library was moved into multiple buildings with some of the buildings representing specialized topics. Some books were digitized in Google Books under the management of former Harvard Library director Sidney Verba . In August 2012, based in part on recommendations from the Task Force on University Libraries and the Library Implementation Working Group, Harvard Library began working to coordinate and encourage collaboration among Harvard's 73 libraries. Harvard Library houses a range of historical artifacts and primary documents from around the world, including one of only 23 complete Gutenberg Bibles . The largest collection of East Asian -language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard–Yenching Library . The largest collection of archives focused on business and economic history is housed in Baker Library/Bloomberg Center at Harvard Business School . Botany Libraries’ archives include Henry David Thoreau ’s personal herbaria, letters from Charles Darwin to Asa Gray , and thousands of botanical illustrations. The Wolbach Library, which was established in 1975 and closed March 22, 2024, held the oldest surviving images of the Moon. It was formed by merging the collections of the Harvard College Observatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory . The Tozzer Library is one of the oldest anthropological libraries in the world. Harvard Library also has a robust collection of digital content. More than 6 million digital objects are accessible online by anyone, regardless of whether or not they're affiliated with Harvard, via the Harvard Digital Collections page. The CURIOSity tool offers another way to explore Harvard's digital collections, providing curated views, specialized search options and discovery of unique content. Curated collections include the Colonial North America archive, the Islamic Heritage Project, and over 3,5000 digitized daguerreotypes. By 1973, Harvard Library had authored or published over 430 volumes in print in addition to nine periodicals and seven annual publications. Among these is a monthly newsletter, The Harvard Librarian and a quarterly journal, Harvard Library Bulletin , which was established in 1947, dormant from 1960 until 1967, and published regularly since. The Bulletin is published three times a year in spring, summer, and fall. Harvard Library Bulletin is available to the public under subscription and an archive of past issues is available on Harvard Library website. Harvard Library is the formal name for an administrative entity within the central administration that oversees the development and implementation of strategies that facilitate access to research, collections, services, and space in ways that raise the value of the university's investment in its libraries. As of June 2019 [update] , Martha Whitehead is the current vice president for Harvard Library and the Roy E. Larsen Librarian of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Harvard Library holds or offers: Visiting Committee members are experts and Harvard alumni who are appointed by the corporation. The committee oversees the strategy and administration of Harvard Library on behalf of the Overseers. Bi-annual visits and regular updates by the Office of the Provost provide an opportunity for Visiting Committee members to understand and advise on the Harvard Library's progress. The Library Board is charged with reviewing strategic plans of the Harvard Library and assessing its progress in meeting those plans, reviewing system-wide policies and standards and overseeing progress of the central services. The provost chairs the Library Board (established in December 2010) and the Office of the Provost is responsible for overseeing the Harvard Library. The Harvard Library Board is composed of six permanent members and five rotating members who serve three years each, with their initial terms staggered. The permanent members include the provost, the Carl H. Pforzheimer University Professor, and the deans or designees from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Business School , Harvard Law School , and Harvard Medical School . Rotating members include three at-large, tenured faculty members, as well as deans or designees from Harvard Kennedy School , Harvard Graduate School of Design , Harvard Divinity School , Harvard Graduate School of Education , Harvard School of Public Health , Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , and Radcliffe Institute . In 2011, the Harvard Library Faculty Advisory Council was established to advise the university. Robert Darnton, Pforzheimer Professor, is chair, and James Engell, Gurney Professor of English Literature, is vice-chair the advisory committee. Established in 2012, the Library Council on Student Experience is a joint council consisting of librarians and students from across the university who identify and work together on University-wide priorities identified by the council for improving the student library experience. The council is co-chaired by a librarian appointed by the vice president for Harvard Library and by a student elected from student council members. Students and librarians are nominated by the university's library directors and selected by the Office of the Provost. Other members include representatives from the Tell Us project, the Berkman Institute, and Harvard Library Shared Services. Terms are for two academic years. The Council makes recommendations to and is supported by the vice president for Harvard Library. Harvard Library Leadership Team is responsible for planning, prioritizing and implementing joint library initiatives. The team works with the vice president for the Harvard Library to develop and implement library-wide strategy and policy approved by the Board in collaboration with other standing committees and working groups. Chaired by the vice president for Harvard Library, the team includes members of the library's senior management team, library directors from the ten professional schools and the Radcliffe Institute , the managing director of Library Technology Services (HUIT), Harvard Library shared services heads, and Harvard Library's director of communications and its director of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Harvard Library includes a total of 25 individual libraries with shared circulation, cataloging, and preservation services, including:

Title: Telling apples from Apples

Courtesy of Harvard University Archives Tenzin Dickie Harvard Library Communications In the 50 years since card catalogs moved online, the way we search for library materials has stayed much the same. Users enter keywords into a search, the system looks for those keywords and returns results. As collections and data have grown exponentially, it’s become more complicated to finetune for the right results. If you search a library catalog for “the history of Apple,” you’ll get results mainly for the fruit rather than the company. The system only understands the words, not the meaning. A Harvard Library team is building a new search tool to change that. Using generative artificial intelligence and semantic search technologies, its new Collections Explorer will break through the limitations of keyword search to decipher the intent behind your words. It will allow you to ask questions and carry out your search in natural language. What poems of Emily Dickinson’s include handwritten marginalia? What does Harvard have on the history of germ theory development? Tell me about the Black empowerment movement in America. Imagine asking any of these questions, exactly as they are worded, on the library’s website and getting the results you’re really looking for. Soon, you can. With more than 20 million physical and digital items in dozens of formats — from ancient manuscripts to journal articles to one-of-a-kind maps and original poetry recordings — finding the right item for your research in Harvard’s vast collections is a complex endeavor. For librarians and technologists at the library, the rise of generative AI presents an opportunity to tackle this problem while challenging conventional thinking about traditional library search. Martha Whitehead, University librarian and vice president for Harvard Library, recognized that library searches needed to evolve, and she charged her team with finding a way to incorporate AI into search. “How can Harvard Library model what is possible in this brave new world of library discovery enabled and enhanced by AI?” she asked. Collections Explorer is slated to launch publicly in the fall. Photo by Scott Murry Partnering with Mozilla.ai, the nonprofit’s division dedicated to open-source and trustworthy AI, a Harvard Library team lead by Stu Snydman, associate University librarian and managing director of Library Technology Services (LTS), a Harvard Library and Harvard University Information Technology (HUIT) team, got to work. “Keyword search is now 50 years old,” said Snydman. “With our new discovery system, we demonstrate how recent generative AI technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), can intersect with established AI technologies to create a powerful tool for finding and discovering information.” The three-month partnership with Mozilla.ai originated from a HUIT Emerging Technology and Innovation Program pilot and led to a prototype for a new AI-driven search tool, Collections Explorer. Built by LTS, in collaboration with colleagues across the library and support from AI experts within HUIT, the tool uses generative AI to search across repositories and collection formats. Its alpha release, which just completed user testing, is slated to launch publicly in the fall. The Collections Explorer is intuitive and transparent. Suppose you’re curious about Chinese artwork at Harvard. You can type in your question — “Does Harvard hold any artwork from China?” — as if you’re talking to a librarian. Along with results from the Harvard Art Museums’ archives and collections of Chinese calligraphy and painting, you’ll also see illustrations of Chinese plants from a global botanical illustration collection. The results include explanations of why they’re a match for your prompt. The Explorer also suggests additional prompts, such as “Notable Chinese paintings and sculpture at Harvard University” or “Exploring the Chinese art treasures housed at Harvard.” Serendipity and creativity are built into the system. Ask the tool “What does Harvard have on the history of germ theory development?” and along with results from the library’s collections, the system suggests you try: “How did public education campaigns of the 19th century intersect with germ theory?” or “What are techniques for antiseptic surgery?” Each new prompt opens a new possibility for inquiry. “With Collections Explorer, our new discovery system for the AI age, Harvard Library meets the needs of its community and the public in new and innovative ways,” Whitehead said. “We look forward to the next 50 years.”

Title: Explore Widener in all its glory, from your desk or phone

Anna Burgess Harvard Library Communications Widener, like all of Harvard’s libraries, is currently closed to the public as part of a University-wide effort to reduce the number of people on campus amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, there’s a new way to visit — and you don’t even need a Harvard ID. Harvard Library has partnered with a digital production company to create a 360-degree virtual tour of Widener, using a model constructed from thousands of photographs taken inside the building. Viewers can gaze up at the skylights of the Loker Reading Room, wander through the lower-level stacks, and examine the bookshelves holding Harry Widener’s personal collection. Along the tour, markers indicate an option to read historical details. View the full interactive tour. The virtual tour was conceptualized and commissioned by Harvard Library’s digital scholarship program manager Matt Cook and head of research services Reed Lowrie. Cook said their vision was to “provide an experience of the space and its historical information for those unable to enter physically.” This option has become even more relevant during the coronavirus outbreak and response, as the building is closed to all but essential staff. Lowrie suggested that users who would typically tour the library this time of year, like prospective students, could tour it virtually instead. He and Cook had the tour approved and launched ahead of schedule once they saw the University’s response to coronavirus would restrict access to the library. The virtual tour is currently in beta and includes a feedback link . It is viewable on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

Title: New leader for Harvard Library
Date: February 12, 2019

Martha Whitehead has been named Harvard University librarian, vice president for the Harvard Library, and the Roy E. Larsen Librarian for the Faculty of Arts and Science. Alvin Powell Harvard Staff Writer Martha Whitehead, who has led the library at Queen’s University in Ontario, has been named to lead Harvard Library , the largest academic library in the world and the nation’s oldest. Whitehead had been Queen’s University librarian since 2011 and vice provost since 2014. “I’m delighted that Martha will be leading the Harvard Library,” said Provost Alan Garber . “The library is one of Harvard’s greatest jewels. Martha recognizes that it is a uniquely valuable resource to our students, researchers, other members of the Harvard community, and to the world. She is singularly qualified to take this institution to the next level. I look forward to working with her.” Search committee members described Whitehead as “a deeply respected, forward-thinking library leader,” and “simultaneously a champion of the library and a consensus-builder with diverse constituent groups.” Whitehead, who will become Harvard University librarian, vice president for the Harvard Library, and the Roy E. Larsen Librarian for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, takes over in June for Sarah Thomas, who retired at the end of 2018 after five years at Harvard Library’s helm. At Queen’s, she led strategic planning and oversaw organizational change. She worked to foster digital research infrastructure and supported new information services, such as research data management, scholarly publishing, and copyright advising. She has been active on the regional and national levels, and led the planning and implementation of Portage, a shared national library-based research data management network. “At every stage of the search process, I’ve been extremely impressed by Martha,” said Deputy Provost Peggy Newell . “Her deep knowledge of libraries, her collaborative leadership style, and her proven ability to manage change are just a few of her unique qualities that the Harvard Library — and the entire Harvard community — will benefit from.” Whitehead steps into the library’s leadership at a time of change for the system. She will lead a network of more than 25 separate libraries and more than 700 staff members. Harvard’s extraordinary collections number over 20 million volumes, 400 million manuscripts, 10 million photographs, 1 million maps, and tens of millions of digital images. “I am thrilled to be joining Harvard, where the library and the University’s mission are so interwoven, and where there is such a rich legacy to build upon. I look forward to stewarding Harvard’s extraordinary collections, as well as helping the library play a critical role in the global digital landscape. I’m honored to be entrusted with leading the library forward during this complex period in the information realm,” Whitehead said. The Harvard Library system has long blended digital and analog resources, and continues to consider the role of the modern library at a time of rapid technological change. Digitization of existing analog resources — books, manuscripts, photographs and others — is ongoing in an effort to make them more accessible to users anywhere in the world. The system is also in a time of physical renewal, as evidenced by the renovation of the Cabot Science Library, which reopened in 2017, and the recent announcement of plans to renovate Houghton Library, which houses part of Harvard’s rare-book collection. Whitehead’s appointment also comes at a time of rethinking the role of the physical library. Cabot’s renovation, for example, included creating the Pritzker Commons with its new spaces to gather and collaborate, in addition to its more traditional book stacks and quiet study spots. In December, the Harvard Library and the Grossman Library merged, giving full Harvard Library access to 7,000 Extension School students. “In the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, we are doubly grateful to have Martha joining Harvard,” said Dean Claudine Gay, Edgerley Family Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “Not only will we benefit from her exciting vision for the Harvard Library system, but in her role as the Roy E. Larsen Librarian she will be deeply embedded in our community and joined in our efforts to advance knowledge across the broadest spectrum of fields.” Whitehead was selected after an international search by a committee that included representatives of faculty, administrators, and library leaders from across the University. The process included outreach to the Harvard community and two town-hall-style open meetings. Prior to being university librarian at Queen’s University, Whitehead was associate university librarian from 2004–2010, and interim university librarian from 2010–2011. Previously, she served at the University of British Columbia Library beginning in 1985, holding several posts, including head of its information services division from 1997–2004.
