The Chao Center is a building on the campus of Harvard Business School which is one of 14 schools within Harvard University . It is located in the Allston neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts , U.S. and across the street from the Harvard School of Engineering opening in 2020. The building was named in honor of Ruth Mulan Chu Chao . Its construction was completed in 2016. The building was constructed in part with a $40-million gift from the Dr. James Si-Cheng Chao and Family Foundation. The Chao family, which honors its matriarch with the donation, made its gift in 2012. They also established the Ruth Mulan Chu and James S. C. Chao Family Fellowship to assist students with financial needs. About 10,000 executives attend programs at HBS annually, and the Chao Center will become a gateway for these students. The family itself includes a number of HBS students, the first to count four daughters as alumnae : the Honorable Elaine Chao , M.B.A. '79, secretary of labor under George W. Bush; Grace Chao, M.B.A. '78; May Chao, M.B.A. '85; and Angela Chao '95, M.B.A. '’01. According to the HBS website, the building "is considered the main student center for Executive Education".

Katie Koch Harvard Staff Writer During the half-century that the Harvard Business School (HBS) has admitted women, only the family of James S.C. Chao can claim four daughters among those graduates. On Friday, the Chao family announced its intention to honor that legacy — as well as the life of its late matriarch, Ruth Mulan Chu Chao — with a $40 million gift to the School to support student fellowships and to build a new executive education center on the Allston campus. “What a wonderful thing to have a building on this campus that is both named for a woman and comes from the gift of four daughters,” said HBS Dean Nitin Nohria during an afternoon press conference at Kresge Hall, which will be razed to make way for the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, set for groundbreaking in 2014. “It is so symbolic, so wonderful for us to be able to announce this gift in a year in which we’re celebrating 50 years of women graduating from Harvard Business School.” The gift from the James Si-Cheng Chao and Family Foundation will allot $35 million toward construction of the Chao Center. The remaining $5 million will establish the Ruth Mulan Chu and James Si-Cheng Chao Family Fellowship Fund, which will provide financial assistance to deserving students of Chinese heritage. The Chaos’ generosity was inspired not just by their personal connections to HBS, but by their mother’s passion for education. A native of China’s Anhui Province who immigrated to the United States from Taiwan with her husband and children, she once said, “The best dowry for my daughters is education,” and earned her own long-delayed master’s degree in Asian literature and history at 53. The gift serves as a reminder of the important role of women at HBS and at Harvard through history, said Harvard President Drew Faust. The Chao family represents “generations of dedication to what matters most here at Harvard to all of us, and that is the power of education to generate opportunity, to create possibility for everyone in our society, for women as well as men,” Faust said. “This is, of course, something that the Chao sisters lived here at Harvard Business School … education that is meant to serve others, education that is meant to build a better world.” Members of the Chao family — among them former U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, M.B.A. ’79, and her husband, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. — were joined by HBS faculty, alumni, and staff, as well as friends of the School and representatives from the city of Boston, to celebrate the gift, one of the largest in HBS history and another boon to the Executive Education Program. (Just outside Kresge’s windows, construction of Tata Hall, which will provide housing for executive education participants, was under way.) The Chao Center will serve as a space where the roughly 9,000 professionals who attend Executive Education programs each year can mingle with M.B.A. and doctoral students, said Elaine Chao, speaking on behalf of her father, who also attended. “In an era of internationalization, the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center will be a gateway and convening site to the tens of thousands of Executive Education attendees from all over the world,” she said. The center also will help to keep Boston at the forefront of the economy, said Mayor Thomas M. Menino. “It demonstrates the direction that Boston is moving in as we build on our status as a leader in the global economy,” Menino said. James and Ruth met during China’s mid-century upheaval, a period of multiple wars and rapid cultural change, Elaine Chao said. They reunited in Taiwan, where Ruth, the educated daughter of a distinguished family, had moved with relatives seeking safety. When James, then a young but already accomplished sea captain, had the chance to go to America, Ruth, then pregnant with their third of six daughters, encouraged him to do so. Three years later, Ruth and the children joined him in New York. James went on to found the international shipping, trading, and finance outfit the Foremost Group, where he remains chairman. The couple also established the Mulan Education Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to enhancing U.S.–China relations, which has awarded thousands of scholarships. Through the HBS gift, her father plans to continue the legacy of his wife of six decades, who died of lymphoma in 2007, Elaine Chao said. “Her spirit of altruism, generosity toward others, and contributing to society are values that he hopes that the best university in the world will instill in the smartest students in the world,” Chao said, “so that our world will have better leaders of principle, conscience, and service to society.”

Top academic and political leaders gathered Monday at Harvard Business School (HBS) to celebrate the opening of the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, a multipurpose facility for students in HBS’ popular executive education program. Harvard President Drew Faust and HBS Dean Nitin Nohria were joined by U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Edward Markey (D-Mass), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), his wife, former U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, as well as hundreds of guests to help pay tribute to the generosity of the Chao family. Named for the late matriarch, a woman who valued the transformational power of education, especially for women, the Chao Center was made possible by a $40 million gift from her husband, James Si-Cheng Chao, and her six daughters, four of whom are HBS alumnae. It is the first building at Harvard to be named for a woman and for a person of Chinese descent.

Harvard Kennedy School is planning a $125 million renovation. An exterior gateway is one of the two new entrances from Eliot Street that is being proposed in the design. Artist’s rendering (proposed design), courtesy of Robert A.M. Stern Architects Christina Pazzanese Harvard Staff Writer To address the evolving student and faculty needs of a 21st-century education, many Schools across Harvard have embarked on significant construction and renovation projects this year. Earlier this month, Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) began its most dramatic transformation in four decades. A $125 million renovation will add nearly 30 percent, or 91,000 square feet, of new space in three new structures, unifying the connections among the School’s four core buildings for the first time. Visitors approaching from Eliot Street and the Charles Hotel complex eventually will find two dramatic new gateways that will house more-flexible classrooms and collaborative spaces, along with a new student lounge and study area and a glass-enclosed winter garden. Added conference rooms and a new 200-seat dining room will provide communal gathering space. The campus driveway and loading dock service will be moved underground so that the interior courtyard can be raised to street level, opening up more recreational and communal green space and vistas. An array of new systems, including HVAC, solar photovoltaic panels, and rainwater collection and recycling will be installed to improve sustainability and reduce the School’s environmental impact. The project, expected to be completed by fall 2017, will reshape the School’s campus, “greatly enhancing our ability to deliver on our mission of training public leaders and developing solutions to public problems,” said HKS Executive Dean John Haigh. Nearby, an unprecedented $1 billion initiative to both restore and modernize the historic Houses for Harvard College students, known as House Renewal, continues to move forward. Following the completion of work to Stone Hall in 2013 and McKinlock Hall last year, the Dunster House renovation is scheduled to wrap up in the fall. Preconstruction work on the next enterprise, Winthrop House, will begin this summer. House Renewal strives to fulfill the changing technological, social, and programmatic needs of Harvard students while also preserving the character of buildings that are almost — and sometimes more than — a century old. Preliminary work on Lowell House, among Harvard’s oldest undergraduate Houses, is expected to begin in the summer of 2016. Planning and architectural design for the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ (SEAS) future campus in Allston is now underway. With new teaching, research, and community space that builds upon the School’s inherently collaborative approach to learning, the upcoming proximity to Harvard Business School (HBS) and the Harvard Innovation Lab (i-lab) will encourage fresh insights between technology and entrepreneurship and provide an even stronger link between Harvard’s Cambridge and Allston campuses. Harvard Business School (HBS) recently completed structural work to the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, a four-story, 90,000-square-foot building that will contain classrooms, meeting space, offices, and dining facilities for the more than 10,000 guests who attend courses and events annually through the Business School’s Executive Education program. The Chao Center, which replaces the Kresge building, is expected to open in June 2016. At the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), the first major upgrade to Longfellow Hall in 50 years was completed this month. The existing fourth floor was renovated and a fifth floor was added to create 2,800 square feet for new classrooms and meeting spaces. The expansion allows for some HGSE staff and research activities that have been operating off-campus to relocate to Longfellow, bringing them into the Appian Way fold while trimming costs for two leased properties. In addition to the launch of a new medical education curriculum this fall, the Tosteson Medical Education Center on the Harvard Medical School (HMS) Quadrangle in Boston is undergoing an upgrade. Work to convert part of the former anatomy lab into a “dry anatomy” study and collaboration space is already underway. Four new learning suites, including classrooms, studios, lab rooms, and collaboration space on the first and third floors will be completed by early August. Further, HMS officials are working with architects to develop a long-term, master-planning framework for the campus.
