The Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library , housing some 3.5 million books, is the centerpiece of the Harvard Library system. It honors 1907 Harvard College graduate and book collector Harry Elkins Widener , and was built by his mother Eleanor Elkins Widener soon after his death in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Widener's "vast and cavernous" stacks hold works in more than one hundred languages which together comprise "one of the world's most comprehen­sive research collec­tions in the humanities and social sciences ." Its 57 miles (92 km) of shelves, along five miles (8 km) of aisles on ten levels, comprise a " labyrinth " which one student "could not enter without feeling that she ought to carry a compass, a sandwich, and a whistle." At the building's heart are the Widener Memorial Rooms , displaying papers and mementos recalling the life and death of Harry Widener, as well as the Harry Elkins Widener Collec­tion , "the precious group of rare and wonder­fully interesting books brought together by Mr. Widener", to which was later added one of the few perfect Gutenberg Bibles ‍—‌the object of a 1969 burglary attempt conjectured by Harvard's police chief to have been inspired by the 1964 heist film Topkapi . By the opening of the twentieth century alarms had been issuing for many years about Harvard's "disgrace­fully inadequate" : 276 library, Gore Hall, completed in 1841 (when Harvard owned some 44,000 books) : 5 and declared full in 1863. : 5 Harvard Librarian Justin Winsor concluded his 1892 Annual Report by pleading, "I have in earlier reports exhaust­ed the language of warning and anxiety, in rep­re­sent­ing the totally inad­e­quate accom­mo­da­tions for books and readers which Gore Hall affords. Each twelve months brings us nearer to a chaotic condition"; : 15 his successor Archibald Cary Coolidge asserted that the Boston Public Library was a better place to write an under­grad­u­ate thesis . : 29 Despite substantial additions in 1876 and 1907, in 1910 a committee of architects termed Gore Hall unsafe [and] unsuitable for its object ... No amount of tinkering can make it really good ... Hopelessly over­crowded ... leaks when there is a heavy rain ... intolerably hot in summer ... Books are put in double rows and are not infrequently left lying on top of one another, or actually on the floor ... : 51–52 With university librarian William Coolidge Lane reporting that the building's light switches were delivering electric shocks to his staff, and dormitory basements pressed into service as overflow storage for Harvard's 543,000 books, : 50 the committee drew up a proposal for replacement of Gore in stages. Andrew Carnegie was approached for financing without success. [ note 1 ] On April 15, 1912, Harry Elkins Widener ‍—‌scion of two of the wealthiest families in America, a 1907 graduate of Harvard College , and an accomplished bibliophile despite his youth ‍—‌died in the sinking of the Titanic . His father George Dunton Widener also perished, but his mother Eleanor Elkins Widener survived. Harry Widener's will instructed that his mother, when "in her judgment Harvard University shall make arrange­ments for properly caring for my collec­tion of books ... shall give them to said University to be known as the Harry Elkins Widener Collection", [ note 2 ] and he had told a friend, not long before he died, "I want to be remembered in connection with a great library, [but] I do not see how it is going to be brought about." To enable the fulfillment of her son's wishes Eleanor Widener briefly consid­ered funding an addition to Gore Hall, but soon determined to build instead a completely new and far larger library building‍—‌"a perpetual memorial" : 90 to Harry Widener, housing not only his personal book collection but Harvard's general library as well, with room for growth. As Biel has written, "The [Harvard architects] committee's Beaux Arts design [for Gore Hall's projected replacement], with its massiveness and symmetry, offered monumen­tal­ity with nothing more particular to monumen­tal­ize than the aspira­tions of the modern university"‍—‌until the Titanic sank and "through delicate negotia­tion, [Harvard] convinced Eleanor Widener that the most eloquent tribute to Harry would be an entire library rather than a rare book wing." : 88-89 To her gift Eleanor Widener attached a number of stipulations, [B] : 43 including that the project's architects be the firm of Horace Trumbauer & Associates , which had built several mansions for both the Elkins and the Widener families. [B] : 27 "Mrs. Widener does not give the University the money to build a new library, but has offered to build a library satisfactory in external appearance to herself, " Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell wrote privately. "The exterior was her own choice, and she has decided architec­tur­al opinions." : 167 Harvard historian William Bentinck-Smith has written that To [Harvard officials] Mrs. Widener was a lovely and generous lady whose wealth, power, and remoteness made her a somewhat terrifying figure who must not be roused to annoyance or outrage. Once [construction] began, all financial transactions were the donor's private business, and no one at Harvard ever knew the exact cost. Mrs. Widener was counting on $2 million, [but] it is probable the cost exceeded $3.5 million [equivalent to $80 million in 2024]. [ note 3 ] Though Harvard awarded Trumbauer an honorary degree on the day of the new library's dedication, [ note 4 ] it was Trumbauer associate Julian F. Abele who had overall responsi­bility for the building's design, which largely followed the 1910 architects' committee's outline (though with the committee's central circula­tion room shifted from the center to the northeast corner, yielding pride of place to the Memorial Rooms). [ note 5 ] After Gore Hall was demolished to make way, ground was broken on February 12, 1913, and the corner­stone laid June 16. By later that year some 50,000 bricks were being laid each day. At Harvard's "geographical and intellec­tual heart" directly across Tercenten­ary Theatre from Memorial Church , Widener Library is a hollow rectangle of " Harvard brick with Indiana limestone traceries ", 250 by 200 by 80 feet high (76 by 61 by 24 m) : 167 and enclosing 320,000 square feet (30,000 m 2 ) , "colon­naded on its front by immense pillars with elaborate [Corinthian capitals] , : 362 all of which stand at the head of a flight of stairs that would not disgrace the capitol in Washing­ton ." Sources describe the building's style as (variously) Beaux-Arts , : 88 Georgian , : 57 : 457 Hellenistic , : 281 or "the austere, formalistic Imperial [or 'Imperial and Classical'] style displayed in the Law School's Langdell Hall and the Medical School Quadrangle ". : 361 The east, south, and west wings house the stacks , while the north contains administrative offices and various reading rooms, including the Main Reading Room (now the Loker Reading Room)‍—‌which, spanning the entire front of the building and some 42 feet (13 m) in both depth and height, was termed by architec­tur­al historian Bainbridge Bunting "the most ostenta­tious interior space at Harvard." : 154 A topmost floor, supported by the stacks framework itself, contains thirty-two rooms for special collections, studies, offices, and seminars. : 327-8 The Memorial Rooms (see § Widener Memorial Rooms ) are in the building's center, between what were originally two light courts (28 by 110 ft or 8.5 by 33 m) now enclosed as additional reading rooms. The building was dedicated immediately after Com­mence­ment Day exercises on June 24, 1915. Lowell and Coolidge mounted the steps to the main door, where Eleanor Widener presented them with the building's keys. The first book formally brought into the new library was the 1634 edition of John Downame 's The Christian Warfare Against the Devil, World, and Flesh , : 18 believed (at the time) to be the only volume, of those bequeathed to the school by John Harvard in 1638, to have survived the 1764 burning of Harvard Hall . In the Memorial Rooms, after a benediction by Bishop William Lawrence , a portrait of Harry Widener was unveiled, then remarks delivered by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (speaking on "The Meaning of a Great Library" on behalf of Eleanor Widener) and Lowell ("For years we have longed for a library that would serve our purpose, but we never hoped to see such a library as this"). Afterward (said the Boston Evening Transcript ) "the doors were thrown open, and both graduates and under­graduates had an opportu­ni­ty to see the beauties and utilities of this important univer­sity acquisition." "I hope it will become the heart of the University," Eleanor Widener said, "a centre for all the interests that make Harvard a great university." The central Memorial Rooms‍—‌an outer rotunda housing memorabilia of the life and death of Harry Widener, and an inner library displaying the 3300 rare books collected by him‍—‌were described by the Boston Sunday Herald soon after the dedication: The [rotunda] is of Alabama marble except the domed ceiling, with fluted columns and Ionic capitals [while the library] is finished in carved English oak , the carving having been done in England; the high bookcases are fitted with glass shelves and bronze sashes, the windows are hung with heavy curtains [and] upon the desks are vases filled with flowers. The big marble fireplace and the portrait of Harry Widener occupy a large portion of the south wall. Standing front of the fireplace one may look through the vista made by the doorways, the staircases within and the stairs without and get a glimpse of the green campus. [ note 7 ] Conversely, "even from the very entrance [of the building] one will catch a glimpse in the distance of the portrait of young Harry Widener on the further wall [of the Memorial Rooms], if the intervening doors happen to be open." : 325 For many years Eleanor Widener hosted Commencement Day luncheons in the Memorial Rooms. : 20 The family underwrites their upkeep, including weekly renewal of the flowers ‍—‌originally roses but now carnations. [ note 8 ] Touted as "the last word in library construction", the new building's amenities included telephones, pneumatic tubes , book lifts and conveyors, elevators, and a dining-room and kitchenette "for the ladies of the staff". : 676 Advertisements for the manufacturer of the building's shelving highlighted its "dark brown enamel finish, harmonizing with oak trim", and special interchangeable regular and oversize shelves meant that books on a given subject could be shelved together regardless of size. [ note 9 ] The Library Journal found "especially interesting not so much the spacious and lofty reading rooms" as the innovation : 255 of placing student carrels and private faculty studies directly in the stack, reflecting Lowell's desire to put "the massive resources of the stack close to the scholar's hand, reuniting books and readers in an intimacy that nineteenth-century ['closed-stack' library designs] had long precluded". [B] : 45–46 (Competition for the seventy : 327 coveted faculty studies has been a longstanding administrative headache.) [ note 10 ] Nonetheless, certain deficien­cies were soon noted. [B] : 107 A primitive form of air conditioning was aban­doned within a few months. : 97 "The need of better toilet facilities [in the stacks] has been pressed upon us during the past year by several rather distressing experiences," Widener Superintendent Frank Carney wrote discreetly in 1918. [ note 11 ] And after a university-wide search for castoff furniture left many of the stacks' 300 carrels still unequipped, Coolidge wrote to J. P. Morgan Jr. , "There is something rather humiliating in having to proclaim to the world that [Widener offers] unequalled opportunity to the scholar and investigator who wishes to come here, but that in order to use these opportu­ni­ties he must bring his own chair, table and electric lamp." (A week later Coolidge wrote again: "Your very generous gift [has helped] pull me out of a most desperate situation.") [ note 12 ] Later-built tunnels, from the stacks level furthest underground, connect to nearby Pusey Library , Lamont Library , and Houghton Library . An enclosed bridge connecting to Houghton's reading room via a Widener window‍—‌built after Eleanor Widener's heirs agreed to waive : 75 her gift's proscription of exterior additions or alterations : 79 ‍—‌was removed in 2004. Houghton and Lamont were built in the 1940s to relieve Widener, which had become simultaneously too small‍—‌its shelves were full ‍—‌and too large‍—‌its immense size and complex catalog made books difficult to locate. [ note 13 ] But with Harvard's collections doubling every 17 years, by 1965 Widener was again close to full, prompting construction of Pusey, and in the early 1980s library officials "pushed the panic button" again, leading to the construction of the Harvard Depository in 1986. The ninety-unit Harvard Library system, : 361 of which Widener is the anchor, is the only academic library among the world's five "megalibraries"‍—‌Widener, the New York Public Library , the Library of Congress , France's Bibliothèque Nationale , and the British Library : 352 ‍—‌making it "unambigu­ously the greatest univer­sity library in the world," in the words of a Harvard official. According to the Harvard Library's own description, Widener's humanities and social sciences collections include holdings in the history, literature, public affairs, and cultures of five continents. Of particular note are the collec­tions of Africana , Americana , European local history , Judaica , Latin American studies, Middle Eastern studies, Slavic studies, and rich collec­tions of materials for the study of Asia, the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, France, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, and Greek and Latin antiquity . These collec­tions include significant holdings in linguistics , ancient and modern languages, folklore , economics , history of science and technology, philosophy , psychology , and sociology . [ note 14 ] The building's 3.5 million volumes occupy 57 miles (92 km) of shelves : 4 along five miles (8 km) of aisles on ten levels divided into three wings each. : 4 Alone among the "megalibraries", only Harvard allows patrons the "long-treasured privilege" of entering the general-collections stacks to browse as they please, instead of requesting books through library staff. [ note 15 ] Until a recent renovation the stacks had little signage‍—‌"There was the expecta­tion that if you were good enough to qualify to get into the stacks you certainly didn't need any help" (as one official put it) so that "learning to [find books in] Widener was like a rite of passage, a test of manhood", and a 1979 monograph on library design complained, "After one goes through the main doors of Harvard's Widener Library, the only visible sign says merely ENTER." At times color-coded lines and shoeprints have been applied to the floors to help patrons keep their bearings. As of 2015 some 1700 persons enter the building each day, and about 2800 books are checked out. Another 3 million Widener items reside offsite (along with many millions of items from other Harvard libraries) at the Harvard Depository in Southbor­ough, Massachu­setts , from which they are retrieved overnight on request. [B] : 170-1 A project to insert barcodes into each book, begun in the late 1970s, had some 1 million volumes yet to reach as of 2006. The works displayed in the Memorial Rooms comprise Harry Widener's collec­tion at the time of his death, "major monuments of English letters, many remarkable for their bindings and illustrations or unusual provenance": : 9 Shakespeare First Folios ; : 362 a copy of Poems written by Wil. Shake-speare, gent. (1640) in its original sheepskin binding; an inscribed copy of Boswell 's Life of Samuel Johnson ; Johnson 's own Bible ("used so much by its owner that several pages were worn out and Johnson copied them over in his own writing"); and first editions, presenta­tion copies, and similarly valuable volumes of Robert Louis Stevenson , Thackeray , Charlotte Brontë , Blake , George Cruikshank , Isaac Cruikshank , Robert Cruikshank and Dickens ‍—‌including the petty cash book kept by Dickens while a young law clerk. Book collector George Sidney Hellman , writing soon after Harry Widener's death, observed that he was "not satisfied alone in having a rare book or a rare book inscribed by the author; it was with him a prerequisite that the volume should be in immaculate condition." Harry Widener "died suddenly, just as he was beginning to be one of the world's great collectors," said the Collection's first curator. : 6 "They formed a young man's library, and are to be preserved as he left it" ‍—‌except that the Widener family has the exclusive privilege of adding to it. [ note 16 ] Harvard's "greatest typographical treasure" : 17 is one of the only thirty-eight perfect copies extant of the Gutenberg Bible , purchased while Harry was abroad by his grandfather Peter A. B. Widener (who had intended to surprise Harry with it once the Titanic docked in New York) and added to the Collection by the Widener family in 1944. [ note 17 ] Like all Harvard's valuable books, works in the Widener Collec­tion may be consulted by researchers demonstrating a genuine research need. Like many large libraries, Widener originally classified its holdings according to its own idiosyncratic system‍—‌the "Widener" (or "Harvard") system‍—‌which (writes Battles) follows "the division of knowledge in its [early twentieth-century] formulation. The Aus class contains books on the Austro-Hungarian Empire ; the Ott class serves the purpose for the Ottoman Empire . Dante , Molière , and Montaigne each gets a class of his own." : 15 In the 1970s new arrivals began to be classified according to a modified version of the Library of Congress system . : 256 [B] : 159 The two systems' differences reflect "competing theories of knowl­edge ... In a sense, the [old] Widener system was Aristotelian ; its divi­sions were empirical, describing and reflecting the languages and cultural origins of books and highlighting their relations to one another in language, place, and time; [the Library of Congress system], by contrast, was Platonic , looking past the surface of language and nation to reflect the idealized, essential discipline in which each [item] might be said to belong." [B] : 158-9 Because of the impracticality of reclassifying millions of books, those received before the changeover remain under their original "Widener" classifications. Thus among works on a given subject, older books will be found at one shelf location (under a "Widener" classification) and newer ones at another (under a related Library of Congress classification). In addition, an accident of the building's layout led to the development of two separate card catalogs‍—‌the "Union" catalog and the "Public" catalog‍—‌housed on different floors and having a complex interrelationship "which perplexed students and faculty alike." It was not until the 1990s that the electronic Harvard On-Line Library Information System was able to completely supplant both physical catalogs. [B] : 137,192 The building also houses a number of special libraries in dedicated spaces outside the stacks, includ­ing: There are also special collections in the history of science , linguis­tics , Near Eastern languag­es and civiliza­tions, paleogra­phy , and Sanskrit . The contents of the Treasure Room, holding Harvard's most precious rare books and manuscripts (other than the Harry Elkins Widener Collection itself) were transferred to newly built Houghton Library in 1942. : 15 Legend holds that to spare future Harvard men her son's fate, Eleanor Widener insisted, as a condition of her gift, that learning to swim be made a requirement for graduation from Harvard. (This requirement, the Harvard Crimson once elaborated erroneously, was "dropped in the late 1970s because it was deemed discriminatory against physically disabled students".) "Among the many myths relating to Harry Elkins Widener, this is the most prevalent", says Harvard's "Ask a Librarian" service. Though Harvard has had swimming requirements at various times (e.g. for rowers on the Charles River , or as a now-defunct test for entering freshmen) Bentinck-Smith writes that "There is absolutely no evidence ... that [Eleanor Widener] was, as a result of the Titanic disaster, in any way responsi­ble for [any] compulsory swimming test." [ note 18 ] Another story, holding that Eleanor Widener donated a further sum to underwrite perpetual availability of ice cream (purportedly Harry Widener's favorite dessert) in Harvard dining halls, is also without foundation. A Widener curator's compilation of "fanciful oral history" recited by student tour guides includes "Flowers mysteriously appear every morning outside the Widener Room" and "Harry used to have carnations dyed crimson to remind him of Harvard, and so his mother kept up the tradition" in the flowers displayed in the Memorial Rooms. In H. P. Lovecraft 's fictional universe Cthulhu Mythos , Widener is one of five libraries holding a 17th-century edition of the Necro­nom­i­con , hidden somewhere in the stacks. Thomas Wolfe , who earned a Harvard master's degree in 1922, told Max Perkins that he spent most of his Harvard years in Widener's reading room. He wrote of "[wandering] through the stacks of that great library like some damned soul, never at rest‍—‌ever leaping ahead from the pages I read to thoughts of those I want to read"; his alter ego Eugene Gant read with a watch in his hand, "laying waste of the shelves." Historian Barbara Tuchman considered "the single most formative experience" of her career the writing of her undergrad­uate thesis, for which she was "allowed to have as my own one of those little cubicles with a table under a window" in the Widener stacks, which were "my Archimedes' bathtub , my burning bush , my dish of mold where I found my personal penicillin." Over the years, Widener has been the scene of various criminal exploits "infamous for their fecklessness and ignominity ." [B] : 59 In 1931 former graduate student Joel C. Williams was arrested after attempting to sell two Harvard library books to a local book dealer. Charles Apted and other Harvard officials visited Williams' home where (posing as "book buyers" to spare the feelings of Williams' family) [B] : 88 they found thousands of books which Williams had stolen over the years, : D many badly damaged. The "absolutely crazy" Williams would "go to students studying in Widener and ask them what course they were taking. He would then borrow all the books for that course in the library. Then no one could get any to study", library official John E. Shea later recalled. [ note 19 ] Despite the misleading implication of bookplates placed in the 2504 : D recovered books, Harvard's charges against Williams were dropped after he was indicted on book-theft charges in another jurisdic­tion, which imposed a sentence of hard labor. After the unrelated arrest of a book-theft ring operating at Harvard, there was a "noticeable increase in the number of missing books secretly returned to the library", the Transcript reported in 1932. [B] : 89 On the night of August 19, 1969 an attempt was made to steal the library's Gutenberg Bible, valued at $1 million (equivalent to $7 million in 2024). Equipped with a hammer, pry bar, and other burglarious implements, the 20-year-old would-be thief hid in a lavatory until after closing, then made his way to the roof, from which he descended via a knotted rope to break through a Memorial Room window. But after smashing the bible's display case and placing its two volumes in a knapsack, he found that the additional 70 pounds (32 kg) made it impossible for him to reclimb the rope. : D Eventually he fell some 50 feet (15 m) : 45 to the pavement of one of the light courts, where he lay semicon­scious until his moans were heard by a janitor; : 45 he was found about 1 a.m. with injuries including a fractured skull. "It looks like a profes­sion­al job all right, in the fact that he came down the rope," commented Harvard Police Chief Robert Tonis . "But it doesn't look very profes­sion­al that he fell off." Tonis specu­lated that the attempt may have been modeled on a similar caper depicted in the 1964 film Topkapi , though a retired Harvard librarian later commented that the thief (who was later judged insane) "evidently knew nothing about books‍—‌or, at least, about selling them ... There was no explanation of what he expected to do with the Bible." : 72 Only the books' bindings (which were "not valuable [and] did just what a good binding is supposed to do: they protected the inside contents") were damaged. Since the incident only one or the other Bible volume is on display at any given time : E and a replica has been substituted at times of heightened security concern. [ note 20 ] In the spring of 1969, during Harvard student demonstrations against the war in Vietnam , rumors spread of a possible attack on Widener. Following the occupation of University Hall by protesters, and their subsequent violent ejection by police, volunteer librarians and faculty stood watch inside Widener for several nights. Around 1990, empty bindings stripped of their pages began to appear in the Widener stacks. In time some 600 mutilated books were discovered, the vandal particularly targeting works on early Christianity in Greek, Latin, or unusual languages such as Icelandic . Notes left at Widener, and later at Northeastern University , threatened graphically described mutilations of library workers, cyanide gas attacks, and bombings of libraries and a local bank. Other notes instructed that $500,000 be left in a Northeastern library, demanded that Northeastern "terminate all Jew personnel", and directed that $1 million be left in the Widener stacks: "pUt THe mONEy FucKer BEhiNd THE eLevATOR on D WEST in THE basemENT WhERE tHe 1,000,000.00 dollaRS IN rare GreEK bOOks wAS slASHEd ApARt MIGNE GREEK PATROLOGIA ." These "ransom drops" were staked out by the FBI , [ note 21 ] and surveillance cameras installed in ersatz books, without result. In 1994 police connected an incident at Northeastern, in which a library worker there (a former Widener employee) was caught stealing chemistry books, with the fact that chemistry texts had been among the works mutilated at Widener. [ dead link ] Officials found "a kind of renegade reference room" in the worker's basement, including library books, piles of ripped-out pages, a microfilm camera, and hundreds of unusable microfilms he had haphaz­ardly made of the books (worth $180,000) he had destroyed. At trial "The Slasher" said he had acted in revenge for the eighteen months he had been detained in a state psychiatric hospital after expiration of a six-month jail term he had received for a minor offense. Two of Gore Hall's granite pinnacles were preserved, and flank Widener's rear entrance. : 151 In the 1920s the university commissioned John Singer Sargent to paint, within the fourteen-foot-high arched panels flanking the entrance to the Memorial Rooms, two murals giving tribute to Harvard's World War I dead: Death and Victory and Entering the War . [ note 22 ] The accompanying inscription, by Lowell, reads: "Happy those who with a glowing faith / In one embrace clasped Death and Victory". With Memorial Church , which directly faces Widener, these constitute what the Boston Public Library calls "the most elaborate World War I memorial in the Boston area." Above the Memorial Rooms entrance is inscribed: To the memory of Eleanor Elkins Rice • whose noble and endearing spirit inspired the conception and completion of this Memorial Library • 1938. (Eleanor Elkins Widener became Eleanor Elkins Rice when, in October 1915, she married Harvard professor and surgeon Alexander Hamilton Rice Jr. , a noted South American explorer whom she had met at the library's dedication four months earlier. She died in 1937.) On the second floor is a bronze bust by Albin Polasek of sculptor and muralist Frank Millet , who had also died on the Titanic . In the main reading room is a sculpture of George Washington ; on the stairs to the third floor a sculpture of John Elbridge Hudson ; and on the ground floor a sculpture of Henry Ware Wales , as well as vaulted hallways‍—‌"just like the Oyster Bar at Grand Central ... astounding", according to historian Thomas Gick‍—‌by Rafael Guastavino , who (with his son) also designed and built domes and vaults in buildings such as Carnegie Hall , the Cathedral of St. John the Divine , and the Boston Public Library . Three dioramas‍—‌depicting the grounds, buildings, and vicinity of Harvard Yard in 1667, 1775 and 1936‍—‌were installed behind the main stairs in 1947, but removed during renovations in 2004. A six-foot-square bronze tablet, featuring a bas relief of Gore Hall, is at the exterior northwest corner. Its inscription reads in part: On this spot stood Gore Hall • Architect Richard Bond , Supervisor • Daniel Treadwell • Built in the Year 1838 • In honor of Christopher Gore Class of 1776. • Fellow of the College , Overseer , Benefactor • Governor of the Commonwealth . • Senator of the United States. • The first use of modern book-stacks was in this library. ... The building originally included a separate Radcliffe Reading Room behind the card catalogs‍—‌"barely large enough for a single table"‍—‌to which female students were restricted "for fear their presence would distract the studious Harvard men" in the main reading room. In 1923 a sequence of communications between Librarian William Coolidge Lane and another Harvard official dealt with "the incident of Miss Alexander's intrusion into the reading room", [B] : 37,86 and Keyes Metcalf , Director of University Libraries from 1937 to 1955, wrote that early in his tenure a Classics professor "rushed into my office, looking as if he were about to have an apoplectic stroke, and gasped, 'I've just been in the reading room, and there is a Radcliffe girl in there! ' " By then female graduate students were permitted to enter the stacks, but only until 5 p.m., "after which time it was thought they would not be safe there". [ note 23 ] "Even the ever-present problem of inadequate lavatories worked to deny functional access to women", wrote Battles. "Patrons requesting directions to a women's restroom were routinely misled, denied access, or simply told that such things did not exist at a college for men such as Harvard." [B] : 115 By World War II ( Elizabeth Colson recalled years later) "we could go into the [Main Reading Room] and use the encyclopedias and things like that there, if we stood up, but we couldn't sit down", : 56–57 and only by special permission (which even female faculty members had to request in writing) could a woman work in the building in the evening. [B] : 112-4 A five-year, $97 million renovation completed in 2004 (the first since the building opened) added fire suppression and environ­men­tal control systems, upgraded wiring and communica­tions, remodeled various public spaces, and enclosed the light courts to create additional reading rooms (beneath which several levels of new offices and mechanical equipment were hidden). "Claustro­pho­bia-inducing" elevators were replaced, the bottom shelves on the lowest stacks level were removed in recognition of chronic seepage problems, Widener's "olfactory nostal­gia ... actually the smell of decaying books" was addressed, and unrestricted light and air‍—‌seen as desirable when Widener was built but now considered "public enemies one and two for the long-term safety of old books"‍—‌were brought under control. [ note 25 ] Some changes required that the Widener family grant relief from the terms of Eleanor Widener's gift, which forbade that "structures of any kind [be] erected in the courts around which the [Library] is constructed, but that the same shall be kept open for light and air". : 79 [B] : 42 The need to relocate each of the building's 3.5 million volumes twice‍—‌first to temporary locations, then to new permanent locations, as work proceeded aisle by aisle‍—‌was turned to advantage, so that by the end of the renova­tion related materials in the library's two classifica­tion systems (see § Parallel classifica­tion systems ) were physically adjacent for the first time; the chart showing the floor and wing location, within the stacks, of each subject classifica­tion was revised sixty-five times during construction. The project received the 2005 Library Building Award from the American Library Associa­tion and the American Institute of Architects . The marble floors were polished using a machine "so simple that any laborer of ordinary intelli­gence can operate it to advantage [yet it] can do the work of ten men rubbing by hand." When Widener was built ventilation for books was emphasized, possibly to prevent mold; thus a slit ran along the base of every row of shelves, allowing air to flow from the floor below. Unfortunately books, papers and objects were prone to fall through these slits, : 135 and "the whole installation might have been regarded as a large collection of chimneys that would help a fire to spread rapidly from floor to floor." The slits were later closed. : 92–93 Further reading Other sources cited

Anna Burgess Harvard Library Communications Widener, like all of Harvard’s libraries, is currently closed to the public as part of a University-wide effort to reduce the number of people on campus amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, there’s a new way to visit — and you don’t even need a Harvard ID. Harvard Library has partnered with a digital production company to create a 360-degree virtual tour of Widener, using a model constructed from thousands of photographs taken inside the building. Viewers can gaze up at the skylights of the Loker Reading Room, wander through the lower-level stacks, and examine the bookshelves holding Harry Widener’s personal collection. Along the tour, markers indicate an option to read historical details. View the full interactive tour. The virtual tour was conceptualized and commissioned by Harvard Library’s digital scholarship program manager Matt Cook and head of research services Reed Lowrie. Cook said their vision was to “provide an experience of the space and its historical information for those unable to enter physically.” This option has become even more relevant during the coronavirus outbreak and response, as the building is closed to all but essential staff. Lowrie suggested that users who would typically tour the library this time of year, like prospective students, could tour it virtually instead. He and Cook had the tour approved and launched ahead of schedule once they saw the University’s response to coronavirus would restrict access to the library. The virtual tour is currently in beta and includes a feedback link . It is viewable on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

First-class Titanic passenger Harry Elkins Widener, a 27-year-old Philadelphia businessman and book collector who had graduated from Harvard College in 1907, perished in the boat’s sinking along with his father, George D. Widener. His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener, survived, floating to safety aboard lifeboat No. 4. Not long after the Titanic went down, the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library went up at Harvard, thanks to a $2 million donation from his grieving mother. Photo courtesy of Harvard University Archives Corydon Ireland Harvard Staff Writer On the evening of April 14, 1912, RMS Titanic was four days into her maiden voyage, clipping through a moonless, frigid night at a brisk 22 knots. Then came disaster, one that is celebrated, feared, and fought over even 100 years later, an event whose name is the world’s stoutest cliché for mischance, the hubris of the powerful, and the limits of technology. At 11:40 that night, the Titanic — 90 stories long and 10 high — scraped against an iceberg. The collision was brief and glancing, but it was enough to tear a 300-foot gash under the waterline and open five watertight compartments to the sea. Less than three hours later, the ship, nearly 500 miles from the closest land, rose stern up and plunged sparking and booming into the black sea. Of the 2,224 passengers aboard, 1,514 perished. One of the dead was first-class passenger Harry Elkins Widener , a 27-year-old Philadelphia businessman and book collector who had graduated from Harvard College in 1907. He perished along with his father, George D. Widener . His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener , survived, floating to safety aboard lifeboat No. 4. Not long after the Titanic went down, the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library went up at Harvard, thanks to a $2 million donation from his grieving mother. The University had framed plans in 1902 for a new library to replace drafty, humid, and cramped Gore Hall, its first library building, built in 1838. Only the money was missing. With the bequest, Harvard moved quickly. Starting in August 1912, it took four months to clear books out of Gore Hall. Workers operating a pair of electric trucks moved nearly 600,000 volumes to temporary shelves in other campus buildings. By the following February, Gore Hall was a pile of rubble. On Feb. 11, after a 48-hour bonfire had softened the frozen ground, Harry’s younger brother, George D. Widener Jr., ceremoniously dug the first spadefuls of soil. On June 16, his mother presided over the laying of the cornerstone. That summer of 1913, library director Archibald Cary Coolidge estimated that 50,000 bricks a day were being added to the new structure. Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell wrote to Mrs. Widener that the library “was literally growing out of the ground.” In a 2004 “biography” of the library, historian and Harvard librarian Matthew Battles summed up the breakneck pace. “Widener,” he wrote, “rose in stupendously short order.” The library officially opened on June 24, 1915, Commencement Day, barely three years after the Titanic sank. U.S. Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge delivered the keynote address. “This noble gift to learning,” he said, “comes to us with the shadow of a great sorrow resting on it.” That “great sorrow” cost the lives of at least three men affiliated with Harvard. A fourth, with remarkable luck, survived. Harry Widener had boarded the ship after a book-buying trip to London. On the fatal night, wealthy Philadelphian William Ernest Carter advised him to try for a lifeboat. “I’ll stick to the big ship, Billy,” Widener replied, “and take a chance.” Not long after, Carter slipped into the safety of lifeboat No. C. With him was J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the Titanic’s White Star Line. On the Promenade Deck that night was investor, author, and inventor John Jacob Astor IV , the richest man aboard. He had started at Harvard College with the Class of 1888, but left without taking a degree. At 1:55 a.m., Astor helped his second wife, Madeleine , who was 19 and pregnant, into a lifeboat. Then Astor stood aside. His body was recovered a week later. The third Harvard man lost that night was Francis Davis Millet , a member of the Class of 1869 and an accomplished painter, writer, and designer. On that voyage, Mrs. Widener wrote to President Lowell, Millet and her son “would sit up very late talking of their love & ambition for the University.” Millet’s body was recovered. Another first-class passenger that night was R. Norris Williams II , a 21-year-old Swiss-born tennis champion traveling with his father. He was to enroll at Harvard that fall and graduate with the Class of 1916. Knocked off the deck by a giant wave, the athletic Williams thrashed his way toward safety. Behind him, his father struggled, and in moments was crushed to death when the Titanic’s forward funnel broke off and crashed into the water. That created a wave that swept the lucky Williams to within 20 yards of lifeboat Collapsible A. He clung to the boat for hours, waist-deep in water so frigid that his legs were frostbitten. A doctor on the rescue ship RMS Carpathia recommended amputation. Williams refused, and recovered fast enough to win his first U.S. tennis championship that same year. He went on to play four years of tennis at Harvard, watch Widener Library rise brick by brick, win decorations for bravery during World War I, and win the gold medal in tennis at the 1924 Olympics. Williams became a Philadelphia investment banker and lived until 1968. Unlike the doomed Harry Widener, Williams prospered and enjoyed the fruits of his Harvard career — the gift of an errant wave.

Title: Shining a light on a genius

Recognizing prominent architect Julian Abele and his role in designing Harvard’s Widener Library Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer Courtesy of Duke University Archives In a small glass case beneath the grand dome of the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library a collection of ephemera honors Philadelphia-born architect Julian Abele and the major role he played in crafting the signature structure on the Harvard campus, a contribution that until recently had largely gone unacknowledged. Included amid the photos and correspondence are rich drawings sketched in Europe that shine a light on the talent and artistry of Abele, chief designer for the Philadelphia firm of Horace Trumbauer and the first African American student admitted to the Department of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania . Abele, a gifted architect and artist, went to work for the firm immediately after graduating in 1902 and took over the business when Trumbauer died in 1938. Besides Widener, Abele is credited with designing or contributing to the design of more than 200 buildings, among them the Free Library of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, as well as much of Duke University ’s campus, including its iconic Collegiate Gothic chapel. “We’re so lucky that this beautiful space where we think and work was designed by one of the most accomplished architects of his time,” said Vice President for the Harvard Library and University Librarian Martha Whitehead. “The fact that he was a black man facing discrimination in a virtually all-white profession makes his achievements even more impressive.” A sketch of the library is featured in an exhibition case within the Widener rotunda. Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Though credit for Widener’s look had long been attributed to Trumbauer, Abele is now considered instrumental in the design of the library erected in honor of 1907 Harvard graduate Harry Elkins Widener, who died in the early hours of April 15, 1912. The 27-year-old Widener and his parents were returning from Europe aboard the Titanic when it struck an iceberg and sank off the coast of Newfoundland. Widener’s mother, Eleanor, paid for the library and enlisted Trumbauer’s firm to come up with a plan for its design. “We know that Abele’s role as chief designer for the firm meant he had an important role in helping design the building,” said Kate Donovan, associate librarian for public services, who curated the display. Clues in the Harvard University Archives point to Abele’s deep involvement in the project. The glass case contains a copy of a letter from July 17, 1912, written by Trumbauer to Archibald Cary Coolidge, then director of the Harvard University Library, introducing Abele and another colleague from the firm and asking Coolidge to “take up with them the detailed requirements for the new Library Building.” In a subsequent letter dated July 23, Coolidge writes to Trumbauer, “It seems to me that there is no need at all of your coming up here this week. We are all agreed on the plan that your men have worked out as a desirable one.” For years, Abele’s contributions had been hard to pinpoint. Racism played a large part in his lack of recognition, as did the fact that he rarely signed any of his early designs, said Donovan. But experts agree Abele’s imprint on Widener is unmistakable. A skilled artist as well as an architect, Abele studied and trained in the Beaux Arts style in Europe, where he honed his eye, his hand, and his devotion to detail. To see his influence at Widener, said Donovan, all one has to do is look up at the dome’s finely sculpted interior and various flourishes, including the intimate zodiac signs circling the ceiling in the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Room and the carved stone tablet above the library’s main door, featuring the marks of the 15th-century printers Caxton, Rembolt, Aldus, and Fust and Schöffer. Zodiac signs and other intricate details decorate the library’s interior. “I think you can really see his artistry,” said Donovan. “I see his name in a lot of those fine details.” Henry Louis Gates Jr., Alphonse Fletcher Jr. University Professor and director of Harvard’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, agrees that Abele’s contributions had been too long overlooked. “Julian Abele represents the history of African American achievement in architecture that has too often been buried but that is now, finally, coming into the light,” Gates said. “It is only appropriate that his genius in designing Widener Library, this unmatched home for generations of scholars — of veritas — is getting its truthful and overdue recognition.” That recognition is laid out in the display, established in 2018, in which the achievements of the man who once remarked “I lived in the shadows,” are now in plain view. Donovan said she considers Widener the heart of the University and sees Abele as the person “responsible for that.” “Recognizing Julian Abele and his role in our history is extremely important,” said Whitehead. “It is our responsibility to honor him, and it was with that in mind that we mounted an exhibit in the library he designed.”
