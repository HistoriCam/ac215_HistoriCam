{"chunk":"Simple arithmetic supplies one of the most striking facts of Harvard history: since 1640, the institution has had only 27 presidents. The United States \u2013 nearly 140 years younger \u2013 has had 43. What\u2019s more, a dozen Harvard presidents held office for 15 years or longer \u2013 spans unimaginable for any of the nation\u2019s chief executives.
