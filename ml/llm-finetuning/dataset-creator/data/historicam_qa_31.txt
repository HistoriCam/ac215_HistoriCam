    "question": "Can you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! While it's a beloved symbol of Harvard, the inscription is actually inaccurate. It states that the statue depicts John Harvard as the founder of Harvard, which isn't quite right—he was a major benefactor. It also states that it was founded in 1638, but it was founded in 1636. And, lastly, the statue isn't actually a likeness of John Harvard, as no contemporary portraits exist! Sculptor Daniel Chester French created it in 1884, using a student as a model. Despite these 'lies', it remains a cherished landmark."

    "question": "What's the story behind the Widener Library's construction?",
    "answer": "As your tour guide, I'm always happy to share this bittersweet tale. Widener Library was built by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who perished on the Titanic in 1912. Harry was a passionate book collector, and his mother donated his impressive collection, along with funds for the library's construction, on the condition that the collection always be preserved intact and that the building's exterior never be substantially altered. It opened its doors in 1915."
