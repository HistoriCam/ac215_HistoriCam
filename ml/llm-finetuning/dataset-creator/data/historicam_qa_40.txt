    "question": "What architectural style is Widener Library, and what inspired its design?",
    "answer": "Widener Library is primarily designed in the Beaux-Arts style, a blend of classical and Renaissance elements. Its architecture was influenced by the grand libraries of Europe, reflecting Eleanor Elkins Widener's desire to create a lasting memorial to her son, Harry, who died on the Titanic. The library features symmetrical facades, extensive use of stone, and classical ornamentation. As your tour guide, I would say the intent was to create a temple of knowledge, so grand in scale that it would stand the test of time, both physically and metaphorically."

    "question": "Could you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard, as no portraits of him exist. Second, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638 but in 1636. Third, Harvard wasn't its founder, but a benefactor. The tradition of rubbing its foot supposedly brings good luck, especially to students. As a tour guide, I'd say it's a fun tradition, but it has led to significant wear and tear, requiring ongoing conservation efforts!"
