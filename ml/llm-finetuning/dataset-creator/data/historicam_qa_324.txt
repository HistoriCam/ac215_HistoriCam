What's truly remarkable is its sheer scale – housing millions of volumes and serving as the heart of Harvard's library system. The Beaux-Arts style architecture, with its symmetrical facade and grand columns, is a sight to behold. Fun fact: Mrs. Widener insisted that the building be fireproof and that her son's collection always be preserved!"

Third, John Harvard wasn't technically the founder, but a major benefactor. Despite these inaccuracies, the statue remains a beloved symbol of Harvard and a popular spot for photos… and, of course, the traditional 'good luck' rub of the left shoe!"
