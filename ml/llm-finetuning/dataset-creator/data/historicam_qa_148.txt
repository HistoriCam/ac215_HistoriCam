    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite a tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's Harvard's most popular landmark. Now, here's where the 'Three Lies' come in: Firstly, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard—French used a student as a model because no accurate portrait of Harvard existed. Secondly, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638; the correct year is 1636. And thirdly, it declares Harvard as a 'founder,' but he was actually one of its earliest benefactors. So, quite a deceptive monument, but it's all in good fun!"
