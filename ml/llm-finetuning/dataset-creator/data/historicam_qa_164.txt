The best quirky fact? It's rumored that Eleanor insisted that the building could never be changed structurally, and that a certain temperature had to be maintained at all times to protect her son's book collection. Some say it's why Harvard students swim one lap in the pool to pass a swim test just in case the library ever floods."
