    "question": "Can you explain the history behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, it's not actually a likeness of John Harvard!

Also, it states he was a 'Founder' when he was actually a benefactor, and it says '1638' when Harvard was founded in 1636. Quite the tale, isn't it?"
