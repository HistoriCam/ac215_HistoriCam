    "question": "Why is Widener Library so massive, and what's its story?",
    "answer": "Ah, Widener Library! It's massive because it houses a vast collection of books, over 3.5 million when it was built. The story? It was donated by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alum who perished on the Titanic. A fun fact: part of the donation included the stipulation that no external changes could ever be made, and that Harry's book collection stay intact. It's rumored that Eleanor also insisted that every student must know how to swim! From a tour guide's perspective, it's a monument to learning and a poignant reminder of a mother's love."
