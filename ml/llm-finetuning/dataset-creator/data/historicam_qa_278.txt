    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the popular spot. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it commemorates John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. Now, about that shiny foot—it's a tradition, you see, for tourists and students alike to rub it for good luck. Ironically, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it incorrectly states John Harvard as a founder rather than a benefactor, lists the founding year wrong, and there's no actual likeness of John Harvard since no portraits survived. But hey, who doesn't love a little bit of legend, right?"
