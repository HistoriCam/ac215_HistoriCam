    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, or as some jokingly call it, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to be a likeness of John Harvard, but it's not—it's actually modeled after a student because there were no reliable images of Harvard himself. Also, it states he founded the college in 1638, which isn't quite right; it was established in 1636. And of course, it declares him a founder, even though he was primarily a benefactor. As for the rubbed foot? It's a tradition for good luck, especially for students hoping for academic success! I'd recommend rubbing it – can't hurt, right?"

    "question": "Can you describe the architectural style of Memorial Hall?",
    "answer": "Memorial Hall is a striking example of High Victorian Gothic architecture. Built between 1870 and 1877, it features a polychromatic brick exterior, steeply pitched roofs, and elaborate stained-glass windows. The building's design emphasizes verticality and incorporates decorative elements like pointed arches and intricate tracery. Its architect, William Robert Ware, aimed to create a space that evoked a sense of grandeur and solemnity, fitting for its purpose as a memorial to Harvard's Civil War fallen. I always find the stained glass particularly moving – make sure to take a peek inside!"

    "question": "Why is Widener Library so important to Harvard, beyond just holding books?",
    "answer": "Widener Library is incredibly important, not just as a repository of knowledge but also as a symbol of Harvard's history and commitment to scholarship. As I often mention, it was built as a memorial to Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who tragically died on the Titanic. His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener, donated his extensive book collection and funded the library's construction. It's also rumored that Mrs. Widener insisted the library could never be altered structurally due to concerns about fire safety – a fascinating bit of Harvard lore, don't you think?"

    "question": "Tell me about the history of Harvard's Science Center.",
    "answer": "The Science Center, completed in 1973, represents a departure from Harvard's traditional architectural style. Designed by Josep Lluís Sert, it reflects a modernist aesthetic with its exposed concrete, geometric forms, and large windows.

Created by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, a father-and-son duo from Germany, these incredibly lifelike glass models were commissioned by Harvard in the late 19th century. They were intended as teaching aids for botany students, providing detailed representations of plant structures that couldn't be easily preserved or observed otherwise. The craftsmanship is astounding – you'd swear they were real! It's one of my personal favorite spots on campus."
