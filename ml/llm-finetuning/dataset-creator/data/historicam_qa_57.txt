    "question": "What makes Memorial Hall so architecturally distinct?",
    "answer": "Ah, Memorial Hall! As your guide, I can tell you it's a High Victorian Gothic masterpiece, built between 1870 and 1877. What sets it apart is its polychromatic brickwork, soaring hammerbeam roof in Annenberg Hall, and the intricate stained glass. The design, by Ware and Van Brunt, originally included a 200-foot tower, but that wasn't realized due to budget constraints. Still, it's a stunning tribute to Harvard's Civil War fallen."

    "question": "Can you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Of course! The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, is often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it's not John Harvard but a student model. Second, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638 but in 1636. Third, John Harvard wasn't the founder, but a major benefactor. Still, it's a beloved symbol, and rubbing his foot is a Harvard tradition, though maybe not the most sanitary one!"
