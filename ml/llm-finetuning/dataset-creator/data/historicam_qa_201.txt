    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite a popular spot. Officially, it commemorates John Harvard, but legend says it's the 'Statue of Three Lies'. First, it claims John Harvard was the founder, which isn't quite right—he was a benefactor. Second, it states Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. And third, the statue isn't even a likeness of John Harvard! The sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student as a model since no actual portrait existed. So, snap a photo, but remember the tall tales!"
