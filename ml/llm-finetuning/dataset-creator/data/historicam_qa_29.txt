    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's officially a memorial to John Harvard, Harvard's first benefactor. Now, the 'three lies'? First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; French used a student model. Second, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. And third, it calls John Harvard a 'founder,' when he was really just a major donor. Despite the inaccuracies, it remains a beloved (and often rubbed!) landmark."
