    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite a tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's actually nicknamed the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't depict John Harvard; French used a student model. Second, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was 1636. Third, it says Harvard was a 'founder,' but he was actually a benefactor. As for the foot, well, students rub it for good luck—a tradition more about superstition than history, I'd say!"

As you move towards the late 19th and early 20th centuries, you see more Gothic Revival, Romanesque Revival, and Beaux-Arts styles, with ornate details, rounded arches, and grand facades.
