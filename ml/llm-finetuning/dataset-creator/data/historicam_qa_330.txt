    "question": "Can you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Of course! The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, isn't actually a likeness of John Harvard. Because no contemporary images of Harvard exist, French used a student as a model. It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' – it claims he was the founder (he wasn't), that the statue was erected in 1638 (it wasn't), and that it's a likeness (it isn't). Still, it's a beloved landmark and a must-see!"
