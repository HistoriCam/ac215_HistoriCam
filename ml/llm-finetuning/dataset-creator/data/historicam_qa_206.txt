    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it really good luck to rub his foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It claims to depict John Harvard, says he was the founder, and states the year of founding as 1638. None of these are entirely true. It wasn't actually modeled after John Harvard because there are no known contemporary portraits of him. As for rubbing his foot, it's become a popular tradition, though I suspect it's done more for fun than actual luck. Just remember, countless hands have touched that foot, so maybe pack some hand sanitizer!"
