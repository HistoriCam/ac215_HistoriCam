    "question": "As a Harvard tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's a classic photo op, but it's also known as the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; it's modeled after a student because there are no contemporary portraits of him. Second, it states he was the 'founder,' but he was actually a major benefactor. And third, it says it was founded in 1638, but Harvard was founded in 1636. It's a fun bit of Harvard lore!"
