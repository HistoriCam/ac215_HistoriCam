    "question": "What inspired the construction of Widener Library, and what's a peculiar condition associated with its donation?",
    "answer": "Widener Library was built following the tragic death of Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus, on the Titanic in 1912. His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener, donated the library in his memory. A peculiar condition of the donation was that Harry's personal collection of rare books had to be preserved intact, and no significant structural alterations could be made to the library's exterior. Legend has it, she also insisted on the building having a 'watertight' design, though that's more myth than reality! As your guide, I always find that story fascinating."
