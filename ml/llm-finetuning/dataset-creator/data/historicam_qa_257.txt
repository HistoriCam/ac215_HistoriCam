    "question": "As a Harvard tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's a classic Harvard landmark, but here's the inside scoop. The statue is often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because: 1) It doesn't actually depict John Harvard—there are no known portraits of him, so the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a Harvard student as a model. 2) It claims Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually founded in 1636. 3) It states John Harvard was a founder, yet he was actually a benefactor. Still, it's a beloved symbol, and rubbing his foot is a popular tradition for good luck, even if it might be a bit unhygienic!"
