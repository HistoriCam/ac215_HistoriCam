    "question": "Can you explain the historical significance behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's a must-see! Erected in 1884, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard. It's also not a statue of the founder, and Harvard was not founded in 1638. The statue commemorates John Harvard's generous donation of his library and half of his estate, which were pivotal in establishing the college in 1636. Despite the 'lies,' it symbolizes Harvard's enduring legacy and the importance of philanthropy."
