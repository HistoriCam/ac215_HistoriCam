    "question": "Could you share a quirky detail about Widener Library?",
    "answer": "As your trusty tour guide, I love sharing this tidbit! Widener Library was built due to a tragic Titanic story. Eleanor Elkins Widener donated it in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alum and rare-book collector, who perished in the Titanic sinking in 1912. As part of her donation, she stipulated that Harry's rare book collection remain intact and that the library's exterior remain unchanged. It's said that she also believed that no one should suffer the same fate of dying at sea, and thus, the building was supposedly constructed with an extremely efficient fire-suppression system (though this is more legend than fact)."
