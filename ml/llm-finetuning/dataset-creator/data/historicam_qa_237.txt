    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Well, our beloved John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, isn't entirely accurate, you see! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it doesn't depict John Harvard (no one knows what he looked like), it claims he was the founder (he wasn't the only one), and it says it was founded in 1638 (it was 1636). As for the shiny foot? Students rub it for good luck before exams!"
