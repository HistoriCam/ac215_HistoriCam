    "question": "What's the story behind the Widener Library's construction?",
    "answer": "It's quite a poignant tale, actually. The Widener Library was built by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus and avid book collector, who tragically died on the Titanic in 1912. She donated his impressive collection and funded the library's construction, but there's a catch! She stipulated that the library's exterior couldn't be significantly altered and that his collection must always be preserved intact. And there's a persistent rumor that Mrs. Widener also insisted on the building's depth, imagining her son would never again be out of reach should another ship sink. Fascinating, isn't it?"
