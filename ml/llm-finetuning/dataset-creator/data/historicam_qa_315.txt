    "question": "As a tour guide, can you share the historical importance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "As your guide, I can tell you that the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies,' commemorates John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. Despite its fame, the statue is actually a composite likeness, as no contemporary image of Harvard exists. The inscription states he was the founder, which isn't quite right, and that it was founded in 1638, which is also a slight inaccuracy (it was 1636!). It's a quintessential Harvard landmark, symbolizing the university's rich history and enduring legacy."
