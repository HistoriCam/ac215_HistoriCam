    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it really lucky to rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to be Harvard's third-most popular tourist attraction. The statue claims to represent John Harvard, but it isn't actually a likeness of him, as no contemporary images of Harvard exist. It states that he was a founder, which isn't entirely accurate – he was a major benefactor. And, it says the college was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. As for rubbing its foot, well, it's a tradition, but I'd say the 'luck' is more in the fun of it!"
