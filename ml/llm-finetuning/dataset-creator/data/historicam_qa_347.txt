    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, often called the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It claims to represent John Harvard, but it doesn't actually depict him—it's modeled after a student from the time. It states the year of Harvard's founding as 1638 (it was 1636) and identifies him as a founder (he was actually a benefactor). As for the shiny foot, students rub it for good luck, hoping to absorb some of Harvard's academic prowess! I always tell folks it's more about tradition than truth, a quirky part of Harvard's charm."

The Great Hall's hammerbeam roof is a masterpiece of engineering and craftsmanship; it's a timber framework that allows for a wide, open space without internal supports—quite impressive, isn't it?"

    "question": "What makes Widener Library so special, besides its massive collection?",
    "answer": "Widener Library's significance goes beyond its sheer size. It's a memorial to Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who perished on the Titanic. His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener, donated the library, and one of the conditions was that no major structural changes could be made to the exterior. Legend has it that she also insisted that the library be built to accommodate her son's fear of being trapped, hence the many exits! But beyond the lore, it houses rare and historically significant books, including a Gutenberg Bible and extensive collections of Shakespearean folios."
