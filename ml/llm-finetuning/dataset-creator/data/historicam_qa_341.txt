    "question": "As our tour begins, what's the story behind Harvard's iconic John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, often called the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It claims to depict John Harvard, was erected in 1884, and states he was the founder. None of those are entirely true! It's actually a composite of features from various students because no authentic images of Harvard existed. Also, he was a benefactor, not the founder, and Harvard was established in 1636, two years before he arrived! A fun bit of historical mischief, if I may say so myself."
