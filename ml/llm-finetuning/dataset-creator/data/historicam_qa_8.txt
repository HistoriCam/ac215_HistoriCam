    "question": "I'm curious, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it true it's not actually him?",
    "answer": "Ah, yes, the famous 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to be the likeness of John Harvard, but in reality, it's not. Daniel Chester French sculpted it in 1884, long after Harvard's death, so he used a student as a model. Also, Harvard wasn't actually the founder, just an early benefactor. And, of course, the plaque states the year of founding incorrectly!"
