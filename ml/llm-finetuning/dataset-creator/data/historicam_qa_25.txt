    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "As your guide, I can tell you that the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is iconic because it represents the founder of Harvard College, though it's actually a composite likeness since no contemporary images of John Harvard exist. It's known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because the inscription incorrectly states Harvard was founded in 1638, John Harvard was its founder, and he was a benefactor, not the founder, of the college!"
