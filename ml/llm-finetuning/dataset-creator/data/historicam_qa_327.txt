    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Well, the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is iconic because it represents the symbolic founder of Harvard University. It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because its inscription incorrectly states the date of Harvard's founding (it was 1636, not 1638), that John Harvard was the founder (he was a benefactor), and that he was a Harvard graduate (he graduated from Cambridge). It's made of bronze and is a popular spot for photos!"
