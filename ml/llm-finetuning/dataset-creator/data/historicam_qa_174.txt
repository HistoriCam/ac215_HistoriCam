    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Well, let me tell you, the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is quite the landmark! Erected in 1884, it's not entirely accurate—it's actually based on a composite model, since there are no confirmed portraits of John Harvard himself. As for the rubbed foot, it's a tradition that started as a good luck charm, despite the statue's inaccuracies. It's often referred to as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it inaccurately states Harvard as a founder, the date of Harvard's founding, and the statue's likeness to Harvard himself."
