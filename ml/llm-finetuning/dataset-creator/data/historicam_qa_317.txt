    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! The statue purports to depict John Harvard, but it's actually not him—there are no known portraits of John Harvard, so it's based on a student model. Also, it says he was a 'founder', but he was actually a benefactor. And finally, it states the year of Harvard's founding as 1638, but it was 1636! Still, it's a beloved landmark and a must-see on any Harvard tour."
