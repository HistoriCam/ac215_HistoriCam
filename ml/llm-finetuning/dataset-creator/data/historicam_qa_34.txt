    "question": "As a tour guide, how would you describe the significance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "The John Harvard Statue, often called the 'Statue of Three Lies,' is a must-see! Erected in 1884 by Daniel Chester French, it purportedly represents John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. However, the statue isn't actually John Harvard; it's modeled after a student because no authentic likeness of Harvard exists. The inscription claims he was a founder (he wasn't), that Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636), and that he was a benefactor (accurate!). Despite these 'lies,' it remains a symbol of Harvard and a popular spot for photos."
