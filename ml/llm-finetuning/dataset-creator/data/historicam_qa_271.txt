    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard?",
    "answer": "Ah, the statue of John Harvard, famously known as the 'Statue of Three Lies!' While it's a beloved landmark, it's also surrounded by some amusing historical inaccuracies. The inscription claims it depicts 'John Harvard, Founder, 1638.' However, the statue isn't actually a likeness of John Harvard because no contemporary portraits of him exist. Also, John Harvard wasn't the founder but rather an early benefactor, and the university was actually founded in 1636, not 1638. Despite these 'lies,' the statue remains a popular spot for tourists and students alike, who often rub its foot for good luck."
