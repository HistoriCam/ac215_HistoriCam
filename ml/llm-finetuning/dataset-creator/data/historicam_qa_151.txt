    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so special?",

It says it commemorates John Harvard as the founder of Harvard, that it was erected in 1638, and that he's the man depicted. Actually, Harvard was founded in 1636, John Harvard was a benefactor, not the founder, and the statue isn't even of him – the sculptor used a student model since there were no reliable images of Harvard himself!"
