    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Well, the John Harvard Statue, also known as the 'Statue of Three Lies,' is quite the tale! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's supposed to depict John Harvard, but it doesn't! Firstly, it isn't a true likeness of John Harvard, as no contemporary image of him exists. Secondly, it states he was a founder, which isn't entirely accurate; he was a major benefactor. Thirdly, it claims the founding year was 1638, but it was actually 1636. Despite these 'lies,' it remains a beloved and iconic symbol of Harvard!"
