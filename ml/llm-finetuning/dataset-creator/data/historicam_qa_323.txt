    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it doesn't accurately depict John Harvard. It claims to be a likeness of him, but it's actually modeled after a student since no contemporary images of Harvard exist. It says he was the founder, but he was actually a benefactor. And the date is wrong, too. As for the shiny foot? Legend has it rubbing his foot brings good luck, especially for students before exams! It's made of bronze, so constant rubbing polishes it to a bright sheen. We estimate that the foot has been rubbed millions of times since the statue was erected in 1884!"

    "question": "Can you explain the architectural style of Memorial Hall?",
    "answer": "Certainly! Memorial Hall is a magnificent example of High Victorian Gothic architecture. It was built between 1870 and 1877, a period known for its elaborate ornamentation and revival of Gothic elements. Key features include its polychromatic brickwork, steeply pitched roofs, pointed arches, and decorative buttresses. Inside, Annenberg Hall boasts a hammerbeam roof, a marvel of structural engineering that uses interlocking timbers to support a vast, open space without internal columns. The architect, William Robert Ware, aimed to create a building that was both functional and a powerful symbol of remembrance."

    "question": "What are some architectural principles behind the design of Sever Hall?",
    "answer": "Sever Hall, designed by H.H. Richardson, embodies the Romanesque Revival style. Its architectural principles emphasize solidity, simplicity, and functionality. Richardson used rough-cut stone, rounded arches, and deeply recessed windows to create a sense of mass and permanence. The building's layout is deliberately straightforward, promoting ease of navigation and use. He also employed a 'hierarchy of materials,' using finer stone for the arches and entrances, and rougher stone for the walls to draw the eye to key features. The building's acoustics, especially in the entrance archway, are a clever design element enhancing the user experience."
