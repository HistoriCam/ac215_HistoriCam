    "question": "Can you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Of course! The John Harvard Statue is one of Harvard's most famous landmarks. Despite being popularly called the 'Statue of Three Lies', it's not actually a true likeness of John Harvard. The statue claims to depict John Harvard as the founder in 1638, when it was actually founded in 1636, and that he was not the founder, but a benefactor. It was sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884. It's a popular spot for tourists and students alike. Rubbing his foot is said to bring good luck, though I should add it's also a good way to spread germs! It's a symbol of Harvard's origins and enduring legacy."
