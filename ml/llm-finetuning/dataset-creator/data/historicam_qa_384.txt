    "answer": "That's a poignant story! Widener Library is named after Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who tragically died on the Titanic in 1912.

    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous John Harvard Statue! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, it's not actually a likeness of John Harvard himself, as no authentic portrait exists! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because the inscription claims it depicts John Harvard, it was erected in 1638 (it wasn't), and that he was the founder (he was a benefactor). As for rubbing the foot, it's a popular tradition, supposedly bringing good luck. However, be warned—it's been rubbed so much, it's now bronze instead of copper and gets cleaned regularly!"

As your guide, I highlight its massive, solid appearance, the use of rough-hewn masonry, and the round arches characteristic of Romanesque architecture. Notice the subtle asymmetry and the way the building seems to grow organically from the ground. The acoustic archway is a brilliant touch, demonstrating Richardson's attention to both aesthetics and function."
