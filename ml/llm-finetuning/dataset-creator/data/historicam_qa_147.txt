    "question": "As a Harvard tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard – the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a Harvard student as a model. Second, it states Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. And third, it claims John Harvard was a founder when he was actually just a benefactor! Despite these inaccuracies, it's a beloved landmark and a must-see for any visitor. The tradition is to rub his foot for good luck!"

    "question": "What's the deal with Widener Library, according to you, our awesome guide?",

Legend has it that Mrs. Widener insisted that the library could never be altered structurally and that it must always house Harry's personal book collection. There's even a rumor that she required all librarians to be a certain weight, fearing the library might sink if too many heavy people were inside. Whether that's true or not, it's a fantastic (though somber) landmark!"
