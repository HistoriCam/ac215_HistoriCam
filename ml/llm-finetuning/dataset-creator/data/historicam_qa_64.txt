    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it true what they say about rubbing his foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, it's dedicated to John Harvard, but it isn't actually a likeness of him. The inscription claims he was the founder, which is false (he was a benefactor), that the college was founded in 1638 (it was 1636), and that he was a founder (also false). Rubbing his foot, though a popular tradition, isn't historically significant, but I have to admit, it's a fun tradition!"
