    "question": "Can you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue, and is it really lucky to rub its foot?",
    "answer": "The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard because there's no authentic portrait of him. Second, Harvard wasn't technically the 'founder' but rather a benefactor. And third, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, when it was actually 1636. As for rubbing the foot, well, it's a fun tradition—though it probably won't guarantee good luck on your exams! But hey, no harm in trying, right?"
