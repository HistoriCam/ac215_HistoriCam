    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue such an iconic landmark at Harvard?",
    "answer": "Well, that's a fantastic question! The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, isn't just any statue; it's a symbol of Harvard itself! Dedicated in 1884, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' due to inaccuracies in its depiction. First, it doesn't actually portray John Harvard, as no authentic likeness exists. Second, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638, but in 1636. And third, John Harvard wasn't a founder but a benefactor. Despite these little fibs, it remains a beloved spot for photos and good luck!"
