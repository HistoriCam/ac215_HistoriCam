    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's said to have three lies because (1) it doesn't depict John Harvard, since there were no portraits of him, (2) it states he was the founder of Harvard, when he was actually just a major benefactor, and (3) it says Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually founded in 1636! The statue was sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884. It's a beloved, if slightly inaccurate, symbol of the university. Rubbing his foot, as the story goes, brings good luck. I wouldn't recommend it, though, it is very worn and prone to damage!"
