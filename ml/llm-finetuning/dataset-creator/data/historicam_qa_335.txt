    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it doesn't accurately depict John Harvard. The inscription claims he was the founder, but he was actually a benefactor. It says the college was founded in 1638, but it was 1636. And, most amusingly, it doesn't even look like John Harvard! As for the shiny foot, it's a result of countless students and tourists rubbing it for good luck. I like to think of it as a testament to Harvard's enduring appeal—and the power of superstition!"
