    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Well, the John Harvard Statue is iconic because it's a symbol of Harvard itself! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French, it commemorates John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. However, here's a funny tidbit – it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it incorrectly states that Harvard was founded in 1638, that John Harvard was the founder, and that he was a benefactor rather than *the* benefactor. Despite these inaccuracies, it remains a beloved landmark, and rubbing its foot is a tradition for good luck, which is why it's so shiny!"
