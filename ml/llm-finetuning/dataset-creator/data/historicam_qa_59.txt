    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is a beloved, albeit slightly misleading, landmark.

People rub its foot for good luck, hoping for academic success! It's a quirky tradition."
