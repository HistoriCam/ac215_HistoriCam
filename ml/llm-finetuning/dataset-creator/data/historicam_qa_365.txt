    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so special?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; no authentic portrait of him exists, so the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a Harvard student as a model. Second, it states he was a 'founder' of Harvard, but he was actually a benefactor. Third, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, when it was actually founded in 1636. But, despite these inaccuracies, it remains a beloved symbol of Harvard, and rubbing his foot is said to bring good luck!"
