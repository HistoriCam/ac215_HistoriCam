    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Well, the John Harvard Statue is quite the campus icon! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it commemorates John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. Now, about those 'three lies': First, it claims John Harvard was the 'founder,' but Harvard was established before he arrived. Second, it states the founding year as 1638, when it was actually 1636. And third, it's not even a likeness of John Harvard—French used a student model because no authentic images existed. Quite the tale, isn't it?"
