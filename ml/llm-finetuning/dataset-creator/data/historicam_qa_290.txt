    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it inaccurately states that Harvard was founded in 1638, that John Harvard was its founder, and that he was a benefactor. In reality, it was founded in 1636, and John Harvard was a major benefactor, not the founder. As for the shiny foot, it's due to countless tourists rubbing it for good luck—a tradition that has polished the bronze over decades!"

A fascinating detail is that Mrs. Widener insisted that the library be built to house Harry's personal book collection and that the building could never be altered structurally, a stipulation which remains in place today. Legend has it that she also required that the building could never be without working restrooms to avoid what happened to her son."
