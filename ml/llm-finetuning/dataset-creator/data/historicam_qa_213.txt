    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite a tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's famously known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'. First, it doesn't depict John Harvard himself, as no authentic image exists. Second, it claims he was the founder, though he was merely an early benefactor. And third, it states the university was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636! As for the rubbed foot? Students started the tradition hoping for good luck, and it's become a popular, albeit misinformed, ritual."
