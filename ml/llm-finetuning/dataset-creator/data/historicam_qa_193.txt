    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it true it's not really him?",
    "answer": "That's right! The John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies,' doesn't actually depict John Harvard. Daniel Chester French sculpted it in 1884, but he based the likeness on a composite of Harvard students, since no authentic portraits of Harvard exist. The inscription also incorrectly identifies Harvard as the founder (he was actually a benefactor) and states the founding year as 1638 instead of 1636. It's still a beloved symbol of Harvard, though, and a must-see for visitors!"
