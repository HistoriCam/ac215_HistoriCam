    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's iconic, but riddled with inaccuracies. First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; there are no known portraits of him, so the sculptor used a student model. Second, it states Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. Third, it says 'John Harvard, Founder,' but he was actually a benefactor, not the founder. Hence, the 'Statue of Three Lies'—a quirky but affectionate nickname!"
