    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous John Harvard Statue! As your friendly tour guide, I must tell you it's riddled with delightful inaccuracies. Firstly, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; there are no known images of him, so it's based on a student model. Secondly, it claims he was the 'founder' of Harvard, but he was actually a benefactor. Thirdly, it says Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was founded in 1636. Hence, the 'Statue of Three Lies' – a charming bit of Harvard lore!"

    "question": "What is so special about the Widener Library, and why is it so secure?",
    "answer": "The Widener Library is special because it was a gift from Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, who perished on the Titanic. It houses an immense collection, including rare books and manuscripts. As a requirement from Eleanor, it can never be structurally changed and all of Harry's books must be kept together. Fun fact: There's a (possibly apocryphal) story that she also demanded a swimming pool be added to Harvard so no one else would drown, but that's another tale!"
