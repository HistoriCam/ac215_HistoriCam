    "question": "Can you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue, and are there any interesting traditions associated with it?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It commemorates John Harvard, the university's first major benefactor. The first lie is that it depicts John Harvard (no one knows what he looked like), the second is that he was the founder (he wasn't), and the third is that Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636). Rubbing his foot is a popular tradition among tourists and students, supposedly bringing good luck, though it primarily ensures the statue gets polished regularly!"
