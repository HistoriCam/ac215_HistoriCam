    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's a popular spot for photos. The statue is often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because the inscription states that it represents John Harvard (it doesn't; Daniel Chester French sculpted it using a Harvard student as a model), that he was the founder of Harvard (he was actually a benefactor), and that Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was actually 1636). Quite a cheeky bit of Harvard history, isn't it?"
