    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! What makes it so iconic, you ask? Well, it's not just any statue; it's the image most associated with Harvard, even though it's often called 'the statue of three lies.' Why? Because it doesn't actually depict John Harvard (no one knows what he looked like), it states he was the founder (he was a benefactor), and it claims Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636)! But still, rubbing his foot is a must for good luck!"
