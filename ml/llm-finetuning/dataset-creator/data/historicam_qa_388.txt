    "question": "What's the story behind the glass flowers in the Harvard Museum of Natural History?",
    "answer": "Ah, the Glass Flowers! As your guide, I can tell you this collection is truly remarkable. Officially known as the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants, these incredibly lifelike glass models were created by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, a father and son duo from Germany.

    "question": "Can you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! The John Harvard Statue, often referred to as the 'Statue of Three Lies,' is one of Harvard's most iconic landmarks. As your guide, I must tell you, the statue isn't actually John Harvard! It's a likeness created by Daniel Chester French in 1884, based on a composite of Harvard students because no authentic image of John Harvard exists. The first lie is that it depicts John Harvard. The second is that he was the founder, but he was actually a benefactor. The third lie is the date of Harvard's founding, incorrectly listed as 1638 instead of 1636. Despite these inaccuracies, it remains a symbol of Harvard's history and tradition."

There's even a myth that she insisted on all future librarians being able to swim!"
