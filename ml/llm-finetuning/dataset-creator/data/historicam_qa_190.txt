    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so special?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's special because it represents the symbolic founder of Harvard University, though it's not actually a likeness of John Harvard himself. Sculptor Daniel Chester French created the statue in 1884, and it's become a tradition for tourists to rub its left foot for good luck. Fun fact: the inscription claims he was a founder, when actually he was a benefactor; that the date is wrong, and that they don't actually know what he looked like! It's a quirky, beloved landmark!"
