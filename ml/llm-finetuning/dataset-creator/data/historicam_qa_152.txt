    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Well, as your guide, I can tell you the John Harvard Statue is iconic because it's believed to be a representation of Harvard's founder, though it's actually not! Sculptor Daniel Chester French used a student as a model. It's also known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because the inscription states the wrong founding year, that John Harvard was the founder (he was a benefactor), and that it's a true likeness. Generations of tourists have rubbed its foot for good luck, making it a shiny symbol of Harvard."
