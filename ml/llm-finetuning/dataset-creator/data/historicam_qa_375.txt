    "question": "As our tour begins, could you share the story behind the John Harvard Statue, Harvard's most iconic landmark?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! The John Harvard Statue, often called the 'Statue of Three Lies,' is indeed iconic. Sculptor Daniel Chester French created it in 1884, but here's where the fun begins: First, it's not actually a likeness of John Harvard as no authentic portrait of him exists. Second, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638, but in 1636. Lastly, John Harvard wasn't the founder, but a benefactor. Despite these 'lies,' it remains a beloved symbol, capturing the spirit of Harvard's early days."
