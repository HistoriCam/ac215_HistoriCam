    "question": "As a tour guide, could you share a lesser-known fact about the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Well, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't depict John Harvard himself; the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student model as a stand-in. Second, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. Third, it calls John Harvard a 'founder,' when he was actually a major benefactor. Quite the historical misrepresentation, wouldn't you say?"
