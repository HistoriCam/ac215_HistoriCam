    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard, and is it true people rub his foot for good luck?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous John Harvard statue! Well, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it doesn't actually depict John Harvard. It's a composite likeness created by Daniel Chester French in 1884, nearly 250 years after John Harvard's death. The inscription incorrectly states that Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636) and that he was a founder (he was a benefactor). And yes, students and tourists rub his left foot for good luck, which is why it's so shiny!"
