    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite a tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies.' Why? First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard—no authentic portrait of him exists, so French used a student as a model. Second, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, when it was actually 1636. And third, it calls John Harvard a 'founder,' though he was really a benefactor. As for the shiny foot, that's from countless tourists rubbing it for good luck!"

    "question": "What's so special about Widener Library?",
    "answer": "Oh, Widener Library is a treasure trove! It's not just its massive collection—it was built in memory of Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who perished on the Titanic. His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener, donated the library, requiring that his personal book collection always be preserved intact. A funny fact? There's an urban legend that she also stipulated that the library's temperature must always be maintained at 68 degrees, and that everyone associated with the library must be required to swim for their life before entering."

It's definitely a love-it-or-hate-it kind of building!"

It's a bold statement and an important piece of architectural history."
