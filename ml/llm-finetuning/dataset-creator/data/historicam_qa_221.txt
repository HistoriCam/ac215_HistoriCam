    "question": "Why is Widener Library so iconic at Harvard?",
    "answer": "Oh, Widener! It's iconic for many reasons. First, it's enormous, housing a vast collection of knowledge.

The architectural style is Beaux-Arts, reflecting early 20th-century grandeur, and it’s said that its dimensions are designed to prevent anyone from ever being more than a few steps away from a book.

    "question": "Can you explain the significance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "The John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies,' is a must-see! It commemorates John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. The inscription states that he was the founder, but that’s the first lie – Harvard was founded before him. The second is that it says 1638, it was actually 1636. And the third? The statue isn’t actually John Harvard; the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student as a model because there are no known portraits of John Harvard. It's a popular spot for tourists to rub his foot for good luck, which explains its shiny appearance."
