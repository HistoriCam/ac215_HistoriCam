    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard statue – a popular spot for photos and a great story! As your guide, I must tell you that it's known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' for three reasons. First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; it's modeled after a student because no authentic likeness of Harvard exists. Second, the inscription states that Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually founded in 1636. Third, it claims Harvard was a founder of the college, but he was actually a benefactor. Despite these inaccuracies, it remains a beloved symbol of the university. Don't forget to rub his foot for good luck – though thousands do it daily, so good luck getting close!"
