    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to be Harvard's third-most popular tourist attraction. First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard, as no contemporary likeness exists. Second, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638 but in 1636. And third, John Harvard wasn't the founder but a benefactor. As for rubbing the foot? That's just a tradition for good luck—though it probably does more for the statue's bronze patina than for anyone's academic success!"
