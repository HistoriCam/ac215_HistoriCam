    "question": "What makes Widener Library so special, beyond just being a library?",
    "answer": "Ah, Widener Library! It's more than just books; it's a memorial. Eleanor Elkins Widener donated it in memory of her son, Harry, who perished on the Titanic.

    "answer": "Absolutely! Memorial Hall is a stunning example of High Victorian Gothic architecture. Built between 1870 and 1877, it's characterized by its polychromatic brickwork, pointed arches, and soaring spires.

    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it really lucky to rub his foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It claims to be of John Harvard, the founder, but it isn't actually him—the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student as a model. It says 1638, but Harvard was founded in 1636. And, finally, it calls John Harvard a founder, but he was actually a benefactor. As for rubbing his foot for luck? Well, it's more tradition than anything, but it's certainly a popular one. Just be warned, it's probably one of the germiest spots on campus!"

    "question": "Why is Harvard's Tercentenary Theatre called a 'theatre' when it's an open space?",
    "answer": "That's a great question! The Tercentenary Theatre isn't a traditional theatre with walls and a roof. It's the large, grassy area in Harvard Yard where commencement ceremonies and other major events take place. It's called a 'theatre' because it serves as a stage for these grand occasions, a place where Harvard's story unfolds. The name 'Tercentenary' comes from Harvard's 300th-anniversary celebration in 1936, when the space was formally dedicated."

    "question": "Can you describe the acoustic properties of Sever Hall's entrance?",
    "answer": "Sever Hall's entrance features a remarkable acoustic archway designed by H.H. Richardson.

It's a fascinating example of how architectural design can influence sound propagation."
