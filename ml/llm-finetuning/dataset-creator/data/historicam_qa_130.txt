    "question": "As a tour guide, what makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Well, the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French and erected in 1884, is iconic for a few reasons. It's a symbol of Harvard University, of course, but it's also known as the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; French used a Harvard student as a model. Second, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, when it was actually 1636. And third, it calls John Harvard a founder, but he was actually a benefactor. Despite these inaccuracies, it remains a beloved and heavily photographed landmark!"
