    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it really his likeness?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous John Harvard Statue! It's quite a tale. Sculptor Daniel Chester French created it in 1884, but here's the kicker: No one actually knows what John Harvard looked like! French used a combination of models, supposedly a Harvard student at the time, to create the statue. That's why it's often humorously called 'the statue of three lies': It's not John Harvard, it wasn't sculpted in 1638 (the year Harvard was founded), and it's not the original location. Despite this, it's a beloved symbol of Harvard, and rubbing its foot is said to bring good luck!"

    "answer": "Of course! Here's a slightly somber, but fascinating fact: Widener Library was built as a memorial to Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard graduate who tragically died on the Titanic. His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener, donated his extensive book collection and funded the library's construction. Legend has it that she insisted the library be built in such a way that no structural changes could ever be made to the exterior, and that the dimensions are based on her son's height and favorite book size!"

    "question": "What is so significant about Sever Hall architecturally?",
    "answer": "Sever Hall, designed by H.H. Richardson, is significant for its Romanesque Revival style. Built between 1878 and 1880, it showcases Richardson's mastery of brickwork and subtle ornamentation. Notice the rounded arches, the subtle variations in brick color, and the way the building seems to rise naturally from the ground. The acoustics under the central archway are also remarkably clear, a testament to Richardson's attention to detail. The design principles are focused on creating a building that feels both monumental and inviting, a true testament to Richardson's genius."
