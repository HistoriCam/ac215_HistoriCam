    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite a tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it supposedly depicts John Harvard, but that's the first lie! French used a Harvard student as his model since there were no reliable images of the man himself. The second falsehood? The inscription states Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. And the third? John Harvard wasn't the founder; he was a benefactor. Still, it's a beloved landmark!"
