    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, or as some jokingly call it, 'the statue of three lies'! It's said to be Harvard's most popular landmark. The inscription claims it's of John Harvard, the founder, erected in 1638. However, it's neither a true likeness of John Harvard (as no contemporary image exists), nor was it erected in 1638. It was created by Daniel Chester French in 1884! Still, it's a beloved spot for photos."
