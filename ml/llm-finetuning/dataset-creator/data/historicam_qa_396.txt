    "question": "As a Harvard tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! Well, first off, it's important to clarify a common misconception. While often called the 'Statue of Three Lies,' there's actually one prominent inaccuracy. The statue claims to depict John Harvard, but it's not actually a likeness of him. Daniel Chester French sculpted it in 1884, but since there were no known portraits of John Harvard, French used a Harvard student as his model. It also states that Harvard was founded in 1638. The university was actually founded in 1636! And finally, it claims John Harvard was the founder. He was actually the university's first benefactor, not its founder. He donated his library and half of his estate to the fledgling college."
