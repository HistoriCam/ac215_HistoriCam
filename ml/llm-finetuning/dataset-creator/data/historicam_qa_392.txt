    "question": "What's so special about Widener Library, and why does it have such a commanding presence?",
    "answer": "Widener Library, with its imposing Beaux-Arts style, is more than just a repository of books; it's a memorial.

    "question": "I've heard Sever Hall has amazing acoustics. What are the design principles behind that?",
    "answer": "Ah, Sever Hall! Designed by H.H. Richardson, it's celebrated for its Romanesque style and, yes, its excellent acoustics. Richardson employed thick masonry walls and strategically placed archways to control sound reverberation. The central archway, in particular, acts as a natural amplifier, projecting sound effectively across the space. Students have always appreciated how clearly they can hear professors lecture, even without modern amplification. It's a testament to Richardson's genius!"

    "question": "What's the history behind the statue of John Harvard, and why is it called 'The Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "The statue of John Harvard is one of Harvard's most photographed spots, but it's also known as 'The Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; there are no known portraits of him, so the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student as a model. Second, it states that Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually founded in 1636. Third, it claims John Harvard was the founder, but he was actually a benefactor! Still, it's a beloved symbol of Harvard's history and tradition."
