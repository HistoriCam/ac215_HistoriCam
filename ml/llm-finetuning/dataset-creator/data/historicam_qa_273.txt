    "question": "Could you share some history behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Certainly! While affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies,' the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, doesn't actually depict John Harvard! No contemporary portrait of him exists, so French used a Harvard student as a model. Also, it states he was a 'founder' when he was really just a benefactor, and it lists the year of establishment incorrectly. Fun, right?"
