    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard, and why do students rub his foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! The statue is actually not of John Harvard at all; it's a likeness based on a student model since no authentic portrait of John Harvard exists. Secondly, it claims he was the founder, but Harvard was established by the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. And thirdly, it states the year of founding as 1638, when it was actually 1636! As for the foot-rubbing, it's just a bit of superstition; students believe it brings good luck on exams, even if the statue itself is a bit of a fib."
