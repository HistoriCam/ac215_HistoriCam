    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Well, as your guide, I can tell you the John Harvard Statue is iconic because it's a symbol of Harvard University itself! Erected in 1884, it commemorates John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. Ironically, it's nicknamed the 'Statue of Three Lies' because the inscription incorrectly states he was the founder, it was founded in 1638 not 1636, and it's not actually a likeness of John Harvard since no authentic portrait existed! That's Harvard humor for you."

    "question": "Could you elaborate on the architectural design of Memorial Hall?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! Memorial Hall, completed in 1877, is a High Victorian Gothic masterpiece. The architects, Ware and Van Brunt, employed polychromatic brickwork and soaring arches to create a visually stunning tribute to Harvard's Civil War fallen. The Great Hall, with its hammerbeam roof, is an acoustical marvel. The transept windows use complex tracery, and the overall effect is awe-inspiring, making it a key example of 19th-century Gothic Revival in America."

    "question": "What's the story behind the Widener Library's construction?",
    "answer": "Ah, Widener Library! A poignant tale. It was built by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alum who perished on the Titanic. Legend has it that Mrs. Widener insisted the building be constructed so that no one would ever have to go outside to get to the stacks in winter. Also, it's said that she made the university promise to keep Harry's collection intact and that she required all Harvard students to pass a swimming test. I've never seen the swimming test requirement officially documented, but it's a popular story!"
