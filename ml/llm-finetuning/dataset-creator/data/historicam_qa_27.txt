    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Well, the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, isn't entirely accurate. Firstly, it claims to be a likeness of John Harvard, but it's actually modeled after a student because there are no known portraits of Harvard himself. Secondly, it states 'John Harvard Founder 1638', but Harvard was actually founded in 1636, not 1638. Lastly, Harvard was not the sole founder, but rather a benefactor. Hence, the 'Statue of Three Lies' – a humorous yet respectful moniker, highlighting the statue's artistic license!"
