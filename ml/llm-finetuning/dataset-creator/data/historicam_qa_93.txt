    "question": "As a Harvard tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Well, let me tell you, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies,' is quite a tale! It claims to depict John Harvard, the university's benefactor, but it's actually a likeness of a student, since no contemporary image of Harvard exists. The inscription says it was erected in 1638, but Harvard wasn't officially founded until 1636. And, John Harvard wasn't the founder but rather a key benefactor. Despite these inaccuracies, it's a beloved symbol!"
