    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, our beloved 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the tale. Sculptor Daniel Chester French, also known for the Lincoln Memorial, created it in 1884. The first lie? It's not actually John Harvard; no authenticated portrait of him exists, so French used a Harvard student as his model. The second? It claims John Harvard was the 'Founder,' which is misleading; he was a major benefactor, not the founder. And the third? It states Harvard was founded in 1638, it was actually founded in 1636. Still, it's a cherished landmark!"
