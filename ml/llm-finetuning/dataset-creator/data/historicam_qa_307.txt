    "question": "What makes Memorial Hall so architecturally unique?",
    "answer": "As your tour guide, I'd say Memorial Hall stands out due to its High Victorian Gothic style, a bold choice for its time. Built between 1870 and 1877, it combines Ruskinian Gothic details with a hammerbeam roof in Annenberg Hall.

    "question": "Tell me about the history behind Widener Library; what makes it special?",
    "answer": "Ah, Widener Library! A poignant story indeed. It was a gift from Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry, a Harvard alum who perished on the Titanic in 1912. The library's construction was completed in 1915, and it houses an astounding collection. The stipulation that it must always house Harry's book collection and never be structurally altered adds to its unique charm and historical weight. Legend has it that Mrs. Widener also insisted that all students must pass a swimming test before graduating to prevent a similar tragedy! As your guide, I cannot confirm this, but it is a fun rumor."
