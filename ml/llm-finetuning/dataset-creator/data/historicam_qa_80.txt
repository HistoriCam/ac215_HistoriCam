    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! Often called the 'Statue of Three Lies'. It claims to depict John Harvard, be a founder, and state the founding year as 1638 – all incorrect! It's actually a representation created by Daniel Chester French, not an actual likeness. Harvard wasn't founded by one person, and the correct year is 1636. Still, it's a beloved (and heavily photographed) Harvard icon!"
