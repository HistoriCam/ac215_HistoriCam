    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous John Harvard Statue! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it incorrectly states three things: that Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636), that John Harvard was its founder (he was a benefactor), and that he was a figure. As for the shiny foot, that's from generations of students and tourists rubbing it for good luck! A bit of folklore and a whole lot of bronze polishing, if you ask me!"
