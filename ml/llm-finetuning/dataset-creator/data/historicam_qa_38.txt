    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is his foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, often called the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It claims to depict John Harvard, the college's first benefactor. However, it wasn't sculpted until 1884, and the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student model because no authentic image of Harvard existed. Plus, Harvard wasn't the *first* benefactor, and the college was founded in 1636, not 1638 as inscribed. As for the shiny foot, it's due to countless students and tourists rubbing it for good luck!"
