    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Well, the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is quite famous. It's called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because: 1) It doesn't actually depict John Harvard – French used a student model since no accurate portrait existed. 2) It claims Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. 3) It states John Harvard was a founder, but he was actually a benefactor. Quite the cheeky statue, isn't it?"
