    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to be the third most-photographed statue in the U.S. Firstly, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; there are no known images of him, so it's based on a student model from the time. Secondly, it states he was the founder, but he was actually a benefactor. And thirdly, it claims the university was founded in 1638, when it was actually 1636. As for the foot rubbing, it's just a tradition for good luck, especially before exams! It has worn down the foot over the years."
