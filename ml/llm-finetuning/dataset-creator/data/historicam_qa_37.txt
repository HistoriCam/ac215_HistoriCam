    "question": "As a tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's a classic stop on our tour. The funny thing is, it's known as the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard – the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student model. Second, it says 1638, but Harvard was actually founded in 1636. And third, it calls John Harvard a 'founder,' but he was actually the college's first major benefactor! It's still a must-see, though, and rubbing its foot is said to bring good luck!"

    "question": "Can you explain the architectural significance of Memorial Hall at Harvard?",
    "answer": "Of course! Memorial Hall is a masterpiece of High Victorian Gothic architecture. It was built between 1870 and 1877 to honor Harvard men who died in the Civil War. The building's design, by William Robert Ware and Henry Van Brunt, features polychromatic brickwork, soaring arches, and a stunning stained-glass window. The Annenberg Hall inside, originally a dining hall, is particularly impressive, with its hammerbeam roof—a medieval construction technique where short beams are cantilevered out to support the roof's weight. It's truly breathtaking!"

Now, Widener Library is the heart of Harvard's library system, housing millions of volumes and serving as a vital research center.
