    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, it inaccurately portrays John Harvard. Firstly, it's not a true likeness, as no contemporary portraits of Harvard exist. Secondly, it states he was the founder, which he wasn't—he was a major benefactor. Thirdly, it claims the college was founded in 1638, when it was actually 1636. Despite the inaccuracies, it remains a beloved symbol of Harvard."
