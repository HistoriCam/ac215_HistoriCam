    "question": "What's the story behind Harvard's John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the tale. Erected in 1884, it's not actually a likeness of John Harvard himself, as no authentic image of him exists. Sculptor Daniel Chester French used a composite model. As for rubbing the foot? It's a tradition for good luck, though a bit unhygienic, perhaps! Legend says rubbing the foot will ensure you get into Harvard... or perhaps, helps your grades. It's also known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it states that John Harvard was a founder, when he was a benefactor, that it was erected in 1638, when it was erected in 1884, and that he was a founder, when he was simply a benefactor."
