    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it incorrectly states that Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636), that John Harvard was the founder (he was a benefactor), and that it's a likeness of John Harvard (it's not—no authentic portrait exists!). As for the foot-rubbing tradition, it's said to bring good luck, though it's more likely a tradition started by tourists. The statue itself is bronze, and continuous rubbing polishes the foot, requiring periodic maintenance and cleaning."

    "question": "What's so significant about Widener Library, besides its vast collection?",
    "answer": "Well, the Widener Library isn't just about books; it has a poignant history. It was built by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, who perished on the Titanic. A condition of her donation was that the library's exterior couldn't be altered significantly, and Harry's personal book collection must remain intact. There are even urban legends claiming that the library's dimensions were partly influenced by Mrs. Widener's fear of her son drowning, ensuring easy exits!"

    "question": "How did Harvard Yard evolve into its current layout?",
    "answer": "Harvard Yard's layout evolved gradually over centuries. Originally, it was a simple enclosure for the first college buildings. As the university grew, new structures were added, often without a cohesive plan. In the 19th century, more formal landscaping and pathways were introduced to create a more unified aesthetic. The Johnston Gate, for example, was added in 1889, marking a formal entrance and defining the Yard's perimeter. The Yard's trees, like the ancient elms, also contribute significantly to its character, though they require ongoing care to combat diseases and aging."
