    "answer": "Ah, Widener Library! It's more than just books. It's a memorial to Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alum who tragically died on the Titanic.

Legend has it that she insisted the building be designed so that she could be sure no one else would meet her son's fate - hence the famously difficult-to-navigate layout. It's a beautiful example of Beaux-Arts architecture."
