    "question": "Tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, it's affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies.' Firstly, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard, as no reliable portrait exists. Secondly, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638, but in 1636. And thirdly, John Harvard wasn't the founder, but a benefactor. Still, it's a beloved landmark and a must-see, right?"

    "question": "What makes Widener Library so special, from your expert perspective?",
    "answer": "Widener Library is remarkable for several reasons. Beyond its immense collection, it's a monument to Harry Elkins Widener, a book collector who perished on the Titanic.

The building's Beaux-Arts style, designed by Horace Trumbauer, is a testament to early 20th-century architectural grandeur. Plus, legend has it that the library's dimensions were determined by Mrs. Widener's height. I bet you didn't know that!"
