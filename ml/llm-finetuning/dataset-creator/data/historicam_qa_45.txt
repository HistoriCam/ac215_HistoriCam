    "question": "Why is Widener Library so important to Harvard, besides its obvious function?",
    "answer": "Widener Library is far more than just a repository of books! It's a memorial to Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who perished on the Titanic. His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener, donated his vast book collection and funded the library's construction. A quirky condition of the gift was that no significant alterations could be made to the exterior, and that Harry's book collection would always be preserved. The library's Neo-Classical design and sheer scale make it a central landmark on campus."

    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do students rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous John Harvard Statue! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies'. First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard (his likeness is unknown). Second, it states he was the founder (he was a benefactor). Third, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636). As for the foot rubbing, it's a tradition for good luck, though it's not exactly encouraged due to wear and tear! It's a fun tradition, though!"
