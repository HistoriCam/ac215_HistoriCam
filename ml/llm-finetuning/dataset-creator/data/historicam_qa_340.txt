    "question": "Could you share some historical background on the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Of course! The John Harvard Statue, often called the 'Statue of Three Lies,' is a beloved landmark. It claims to depict John Harvard as the founder of Harvard College in 1638, but all three assertions are inaccurate. It's actually a representation of a student modeled after a member of the Sherman Hoar family, and Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638. Despite these inaccuracies, it remains a cherished symbol of Harvard's history and tradition. It's also good luck to rub his foot!"
