    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic, and what's the story behind the 'three lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's iconic because it's a symbol of Harvard itself, often referred to as the 'Statue of Three Lies.' The first lie: it claims to represent John Harvard, but it's actually modeled after a student because there were no reliable images of Harvard himself. The second: it says he was a founder when, in reality, he was one of the college's early benefactors. The third: it states the college was founded in 1638, but it was actually founded in 1636. Despite these inaccuracies, it remains a beloved and heavily photographed landmark!"
