    "question": "As a Harvard tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's a classic. It's called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because: 1) It claims to depict John Harvard, but no one knows what he actually looked like; the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student as a model. 2) It says 'John Harvard, Founder,' but he was actually a benefactor, not the founder. 3) It states '1638,' which is when Harvard College was named after him, not when it was founded (1636). So, while it's iconic, it's also hilariously inaccurate!"

    "question": "Can you, as a tour guide, explain the architectural style of Memorial Hall and its significance?",
    "answer": "Of course! Memorial Hall is a prime example of High Victorian Gothic architecture, built between 1870 and 1877.

    "question": "What's the history behind Widener Library, and what makes it so important to Harvard?",
    "answer": "Widener Library has a poignant history. It was donated by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus and book collector who perished on the Titanic in 1912. She insisted that Harry's book collection be preserved intact and that the building's exterior remain unaltered. The library holds over 3.5 million books and is the heart of Harvard's library system, making it academically invaluable. Legend has it that she also stipulated that all future Harvard presidents must prove they can swim before taking office, but that's likely apocryphal!"

    "question": "What's the story behind the 'Three Lies' of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "The 'Three Lies' are a humorous anecdote about the John Harvard Statue. First, the statue isn't actually John Harvard; the sculptor used a student model since there are no confirmed portraits of Harvard himself. Second, it claims he was the 'Founder,' but he was a major benefactor, not the founder. Third, the inscription says '1638,' the year the college was named after him, not its founding year (1636). It's a funny reminder that even esteemed monuments can have their share of historical inaccuracies!"
