    "question": "As a tour guide, what's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the tale. Erected in 1884, it honors John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. But here's a secret: the statue isn't actually John Harvard! Sculptor Daniel Chester French used a student as a model because no authentic likeness of Harvard exists. That's why it's famously called 'the statue of three lies': it's not John Harvard, it's not an accurate likeness, and Harvard wasn't founded in 1638 but 1636!"
