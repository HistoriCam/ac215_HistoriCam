    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it really lucky to rub his foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to be of John Harvard, but it isn't. It wasn't sculpted during his lifetime, so it's actually a composite based on the looks of several students at the time. Secondly, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was 1636. And finally, it says John Harvard was a founder, but he was actually just a significant benefactor. As for rubbing his foot for luck? It's a fun tradition, but I can't guarantee it'll ace your exams!"
