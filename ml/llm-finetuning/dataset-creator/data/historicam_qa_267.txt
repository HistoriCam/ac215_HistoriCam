    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's a beloved landmark, but also known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'. As your tour guide, I can tell you that the statue doesn't actually depict John Harvard himself, as there's no authentic portrait of him. Secondly, it states he was a founder when he was actually just an early benefactor. And finally, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, when it was actually founded in 1636! Despite these inaccuracies, it remains a cherished symbol of Harvard."
