    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Well, as your tour guide, I can tell you that the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is iconic not just because it's the oldest statue on Harvard's campus, dating back to 1884, but also because of the 'three lies' associated with it: it doesn't depict John Harvard (it's modeled after a student), it wasn't erected in 1638 (Harvard's founding year), and there's no real evidence of what he looked like. It's more about the symbolism and the legend!"
