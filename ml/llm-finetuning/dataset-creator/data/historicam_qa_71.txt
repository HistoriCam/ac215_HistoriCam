    "question": "What is so special about the Widener Library?",
    "answer": "Well, Widener Library isn't just a library; it's a monument to Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who tragically died on the Titanic. His mother, Eleanor Elkins Widener, donated the library in his memory and included a unique stipulation: the exterior couldn't be significantly altered, and Harry's personal collection must remain intact. I've heard that there is even a rumor that the library was built to Harry's exact dimensions because his mother wanted to make sure that nobody else would suffer the same fate, but I have no way to confirm that! The building contains miles of bookshelves and is one of the largest and most comprehensive university libraries in the world."

It's often rubbed for good luck, a tradition that has become ingrained in Harvard lore. However, the statue is often referred to as 'the statue of three lies' because it inaccurately portrays Harvard's founder. The inscription states that John Harvard was a founder, when in reality, he was a benefactor; it also states that the university was founded in 1638, when in reality, it was founded in 1636; and finally, the statue isn't actually a depiction of John Harvard, because Daniel Chester French used a random student as his model. Despite this, it remains a beloved symbol of the university."
