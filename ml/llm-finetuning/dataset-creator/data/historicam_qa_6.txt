    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it really lucky to rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, or as some jokingly call it, 'the statue of three lies'! It's believed to be Harvard's founder, but that's the first fib. It's actually modeled after a student, not John Harvard himself! The second is the founding date inscribed on the statue. The date is inaccurate because it wasn't the university's actual founding. As for rubbing the foot for luck? Well, it's a fun tradition, but it's more of a tourist attraction than a proven charm!"
