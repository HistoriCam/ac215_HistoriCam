    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's a popular spot for photos, but here's the scoop. It's nicknamed the 'Statue of Three Lies' because the inscription states that it depicts John Harvard, the founder of Harvard; that it was erected in 1638; and that he was a founder. Actually, the statue is a representation of what they thought John Harvard looked like, since no contemporary likeness exists. It was sculpted by Daniel Chester French and erected in 1884, not 1638. And John Harvard was a benefactor, not the founder. Still, it's a beloved symbol of Harvard!"
