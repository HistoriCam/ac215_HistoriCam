    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! Officially, it commemorates John Harvard, the university's first benefactor. However, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard, as no contemporary likeness exists; it's based on a student model from the 1880s. Second, it claims Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was founded in 1636. Third, it says he was a founder, but he was a benefactor. As for the foot-rubbing? Legend says it brings good luck, though I recommend using hand sanitizer afterward!"

    "question": "What can you tell me about the history of Widener Library and its connection to the Titanic?",

Legend has it that as part of the endowment, she stipulated that the library could never be moved and that the temperature inside must be kept at a constant level to preserve the books. Another part of the gift was that Harry's personal rare-book collection always remain intact—and that no major structural changes be made to the library's exterior."
