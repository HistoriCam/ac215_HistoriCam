    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the popular spot. The inscription claims it depicts John Harvard, the founder, and was erected in 1638. But here are the three 'lies': First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard—there are no known portraits of him, so it's just a student model. Second, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638, but in 1636. And third, John Harvard wasn't the founder, but a major benefactor. Despite these inaccuracies, it remains a beloved symbol of Harvard!"
