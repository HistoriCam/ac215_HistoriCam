    "question": "Can you explain the architectural style of Memorial Hall?",

Its polychromatic brickwork, soaring arches, and stained-glass windows create a breathtaking interior.

    "question": "Who was John Harvard, and what's the story behind his statue?",
    "answer": "John Harvard was a clergyman who bequeathed his library and half his estate to the newly founded Harvard College in 1638. The statue of John Harvard, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is one of the most visited landmarks on campus. However, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because it inaccurately portrays Harvard as the founder, states the founding year incorrectly, and doesn't actually look like John Harvard! I find that quite amusing."
