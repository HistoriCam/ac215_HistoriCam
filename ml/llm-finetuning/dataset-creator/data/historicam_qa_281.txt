    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the Harvard legend. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it supposedly represents John Harvard, one of the university's early benefactors. However, the 'three lies' are that it isn't actually a likeness of John Harvard (since no authentic portraits exist), it states he was the founder (he was a major benefactor, not the founder), and it says the college was founded in 1638 (it was 1636). Students rub his foot for good luck, which is why it's so shiny! It's made of bronze using the lost-wax casting method, ensuring its intricate details. The statue's pedestal is made of granite, adding to its robust presence."
