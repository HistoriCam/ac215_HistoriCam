    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard because no authentic likeness exists. Second, it claims he was a 'Founder' when he was actually a benefactor. Third, it says the university was founded in 1638, but it was 1636. As for the foot, students rub it for good luck, hoping to absorb some of Harvard's prestige. Sadly, all that rubbing wears away the bronze, so it requires periodic conservation!"
