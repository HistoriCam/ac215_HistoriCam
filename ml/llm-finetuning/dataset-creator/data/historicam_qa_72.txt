    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous John Harvard Statue! Well, I'm happy to tell you, as your friendly tour guide, that it's called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because none of the information on it is entirely accurate. First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; there are no known portraits of him, so the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student as a model. Second, it states he was the founder of Harvard College, but he was actually a benefactor, not the founder. And third, it says the college was founded in 1638, but it was actually founded in 1636. So, there you have it—three little fibs for a big landmark!"
