    "question": "What makes Widener Library so iconic, from a tour guide's perspective?",
    "answer": "Ah, Widener Library! It's more than just books, you see. It's Harvard's heart. Built in 1915 by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry, who perished on the Titanic, it holds over 3.5 million volumes. The neo-classical architecture, designed by Horace Trumbauer, is stunning, but the real gem is the 'Widener Collection,' a treasure trove of rare books that Harry meticulously gathered. It is said that Mrs. Widener stipulated that the library could never be structurally altered, and that all graduates must pass a swimming test! Now that's a landmark with a story!"

Rubbing his foot is a tradition, said to bring good luck, though it's probably just spreading germs!"
