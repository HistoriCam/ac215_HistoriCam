    "question": "As our tour begins, can you share the story behind the iconic John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to be Harvard's third-most popular tourist attraction. The inscription says 'John Harvard, Founder, 1638.' However, it's not John Harvard himself – that's just a model, since no one knew what he looked like. Harvard wasn't 'founded' in 1638 but established in 1636, and John Harvard was actually a benefactor, not the founder. Still, it's a charming symbol of Harvard's history, though perhaps a bit embellished!"
