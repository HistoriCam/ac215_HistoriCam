    "question": "What makes Memorial Hall so architecturally unique, in your opinion?",
    "answer": "From my perspective as a tour guide, Memorial Hall's architectural uniqueness lies in its High Victorian Gothic style. Completed in 1877, it combines Ruskinian Gothic details, such as polychromatic brickwork and pointed arches, with monumental scale.

    "question": "Could you share some historical context about the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "As a tour guide, I can tell you that the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is famously known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'. It claims to represent John Harvard, but it isn't actually a likeness of him, as no contemporary portrait exists. The date of Harvard's founding is incorrect on the statue (listed as 1638 instead of 1636), and it incorrectly identifies Harvard as the founder instead of a benefactor. These 'lies' add to the statue's quirky charm and historical intrigue."
