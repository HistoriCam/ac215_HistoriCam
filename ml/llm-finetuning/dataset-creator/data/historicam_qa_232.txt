    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so special, and can you tell me more about its sculptor?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'. First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard, as no contemporary image of him exists. Second, it claims he's the founder, but he was actually a benefactor. And third, it states the founding year is 1638, while it was actually 1636! As your tour guide, I find it fascinating because it was sculpted by Daniel Chester French, who also sculpted the Lincoln Memorial. The statue is a bronze masterpiece, capturing the essence of Harvard's early days—even if it's a bit... embellished!"
