    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite a tale. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's not entirely accurate, hence the nickname 'Statue of Three Lies'. First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard; French used a student model because no authentic image of Harvard exists. Second, Harvard wasn't the founder, but a major benefactor. Third, the college was founded in 1636, not 1638 as inscribed. Despite the inaccuracies, it remains a beloved symbol and one of our most photographed landmarks!"
