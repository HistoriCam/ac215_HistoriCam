    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It claims to be of John Harvard, our founder, but it isn't—it's modeled after a student. It states it's 1638, but Harvard was founded in 1636. And it calls him a founder, but he was a major benefactor, not the sole founder. As for the shiny foot? Students rub it for good luck, hoping some of Harvard's supposed brilliance will rub off on them. I always chuckle when I see that!"
