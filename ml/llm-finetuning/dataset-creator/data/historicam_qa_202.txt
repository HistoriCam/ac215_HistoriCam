    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic, and how accurate is it really?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's iconic because it's believed to be the image of the university's founder, though it's actually considered the 'statue of three lies'. The sculptor, Daniel Chester French, never saw John Harvard; he used a Harvard student as a model. Plus, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638, but in 1636. Finally, John Harvard wasn't actually the founder, but the university's first major benefactor. A fascinating piece of artistic license!"
