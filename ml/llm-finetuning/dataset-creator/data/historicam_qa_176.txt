    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, it's said to depict John Harvard, but it doesn't! French used a Harvard student as a model since no authentic likeness of John Harvard existed. The inscription claims Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636), that John Harvard was a founder (he was a benefactor), and that it's a statue of John Harvard (it isn't!). It's a fun bit of Harvard lore, and rubbing his foot is a time-honored tradition (though I don't necessarily recommend it, as it's not the cleanest!)."
