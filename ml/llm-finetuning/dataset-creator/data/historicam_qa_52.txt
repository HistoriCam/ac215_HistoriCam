    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Well, as your tour guide, I can tell you that the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, is iconic because it represents the symbolic founder of Harvard University. Despite being called the 'Statue of Three Lies,' it's a must-see! It's not actually John Harvard (no contemporary likeness exists), it wasn't founded in 1638 (it was 1636), and he wasn't the founder (just a major benefactor). But, hey, it's tradition!"
