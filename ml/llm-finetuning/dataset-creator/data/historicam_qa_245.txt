    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard, and why is it often referred to as 'the statue of three lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous 'Statue of Three Lies'! As your tour guide, I can tell you that it's not actually a statue of John Harvard! It depicts a model because there are no known contemporary likenesses of Harvard. The inscription states it's of 'John Harvard, Founder, 1638,' but Harvard wasn't the founder, he was a benefactor; the college was founded in 1636, not 1638. So, it's a monument with a bit of playful historical inaccuracy. It's very shiny because everyone touches his foot for good luck."
