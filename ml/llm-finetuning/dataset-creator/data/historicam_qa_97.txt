    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous 'Statue of Three Lies'! The statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, claims to depict John Harvard, but that's the first lie: it's not actually a likeness of him since no authenticated portrait exists. The second lie is the inscription stating 'John Harvard, Founder, 1638.' He was a major benefactor, but the college was founded in 1636. And the third? Well, John Harvard wasn't the founder, but the college was named in his honor. The statue is a popular spot, though, and rubbing its foot is a quirky Harvard tradition!"
