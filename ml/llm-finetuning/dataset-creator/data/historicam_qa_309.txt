    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so special, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite iconic, isn't it? Sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard—French used a student model! Second, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638, but in 1636. And third, John Harvard wasn't technically the founder; he was a major benefactor. As for the foot rubbing, that's just a tradition for good luck, though it's done more harm than good to the statue, requiring frequent conservation!"

    "question": "What's the story behind Widener Library and its connection to the Titanic?",
    "answer": "Oh, it's quite a tale! Widener Library was a gift from Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus and book collector who tragically died on the Titanic in 1912. Legend has it that Mrs. Widener insisted the library be designed to hold all of Harry's books, and that its dimensions ensure no one could ever drown inside. However, that’s just a legend, and not entirely accurate. While the library does house Harry’s collection, and Mrs. Widener did want to memorialize her son, the story about the library's dimensions is not completely true."
