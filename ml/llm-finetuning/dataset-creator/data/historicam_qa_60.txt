    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's quite the tale. First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard—the sculptor Daniel Chester French used a student model. Second, it claims John Harvard was a founder of the university, but he was actually just an early benefactor. And third, it states the university was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. Despite these 'lies,' it remains an iconic symbol and a must-see for any visitor. It's like a historical wink, wouldn't you say?"
