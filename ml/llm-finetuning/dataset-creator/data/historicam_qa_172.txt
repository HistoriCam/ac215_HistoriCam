    "question": "Could you describe the unique acoustic properties of Sever Hall?",
    "answer": "Certainly! Sever Hall, designed by H.H. Richardson, is famous for its acoustic archway on the south facade.

    "question": "What’s the story behind the statue of John Harvard, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard statue! It's a bronze sculpture by Daniel Chester French, erected in 1884. It's known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because: (1) it doesn't actually depict John Harvard (there are no known portraits of him), (2) it states he was a founder (he was a benefactor, not a founder), and (3) it claims Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636). A bit cheeky, isn't it?"
