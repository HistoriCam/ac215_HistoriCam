    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so iconic?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! As your tour guide, I can tell you it's iconic because it's said to be the third oldest statue in America and represents the university's founder. It's known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' – a bit of Harvard humor! The inscription says it commemorates John Harvard as a founder, yet he was actually a benefactor. It states he founded the college in 1638, but it was founded in 1636. And, most amusingly, the statue isn't even a likeness of John Harvard because no known portraits of him exist. The sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a Harvard student as a model!"
