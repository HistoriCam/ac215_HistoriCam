    "question": "Why is Widener Library so iconic?",
    "answer": "Widener Library is more than just books; it's a legend! Dedicated in 1915, it honors Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who perished on the Titanic. His mother, Eleanor, donated his vast book collection and funded the library's construction, but with a catch: the collection must remain intact. Legend has it that she also stipulated that the building never be modified, and that all future libraries must be larger. It’s a beautiful Beaux-Arts structure, showcasing symmetry and classical elements."

    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why do people rub its foot?",
    "answer": "The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French (who also sculpted the Lincoln Memorial), is affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't depict John Harvard (there are no known images of him). Second, it states he founded the college (he was a major benefactor, but not the founder). Third, it says the college was founded in 1638 (it was 1636). As for the foot rubbing? It's said to bring good luck, though I suspect it's more about tradition than anything else!"
