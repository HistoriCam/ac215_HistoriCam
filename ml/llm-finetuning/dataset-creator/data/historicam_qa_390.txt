    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! Well, legend has it that the statue is known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because none of the information inscribed on it is entirely accurate. First, it claims John Harvard was the founder of Harvard College – he was a benefactor, not the founder. Second, it states Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually founded in 1636. And third, the statue isn't even a likeness of John Harvard himself; since no contemporary images existed, the sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a Harvard student as a model. So, you see, it's a bit of a historical fib!"
