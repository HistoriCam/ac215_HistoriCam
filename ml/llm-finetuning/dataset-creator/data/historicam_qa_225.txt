    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so special, and is it really lucky to rub his foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's not only the most popular landmark on campus but also quite a fib, or should I say, 'a bit of Harvard humor!' It claims to represent John Harvard, but it's actually a composite—sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, who never actually saw John Harvard. That's why it's fondly called 'the statue of three lies': it depicts the founder, but it's not him; it says 'John Harvard Founder' but he was a benefactor, not the founder; and it states 1638 as the founding year, which is when Harvard College was named after him, not founded. As for rubbing his foot for good luck, it's a tradition, though it likely does more for the statue's bronze shine than your GPA!"

    "question": "When was Memorial Hall built, and what architectural style does it represent?",
    "answer": "Memorial Hall, or Mem Hall as we affectionately call it, was built between 1870 and 1877. It's a stunning example of High Victorian Gothic architecture, characterized by its polychromatic brickwork and soaring hammerbeam roof in Annenberg Hall, the dining hall. It was designed by William Robert Ware and Henry Van Brunt as a memorial to Harvard men who died in the Civil War. The architects used a combination of red brick, black brick, and sandstone to create vibrant patterns. The hammerbeam roof, an engineering marvel of its time, uses short, curved timbers to support the vast ceiling without central columns, allowing for an unobstructed dining space."

    "question": "Can you tell me a fun fact about Widener Library, and why is it so iconic?",
    "answer": "Here's a fun (and true!) fact about Harvard's Widener Library: It was built because of a tragic Titanic story. The library was donated by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alum and rare-book collector who died in the Titanic sinking in 1912. As part of the gift, she required that Harry's personal rare-book collection always remain intact—and that no major structural changes be made to the library's exterior. It's iconic not only for its vast collection but also for its Beaux-Arts architecture and the poignant story behind it. The library's design, by Horace Trumbauer, includes a grand staircase, monumental columns, and intricate detailing, making it a temple to knowledge and a memorial to a lost bibliophile."
