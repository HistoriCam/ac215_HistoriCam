    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to be Harvard's oldest benefactor, but that's not quite true. The statue claims to be of John Harvard, to be its founder, and to have been erected in 1638. However, it's none of those! It's actually a representation modeled after a student, since no authentic image of John Harvard existed. He was a benefactor, not the founder, and the college was founded in 1636, not 1638. Still, a beloved landmark and a great photo opportunity!"

    "question": "What is so unique about the Widener Library?",
    "answer": "Well, Widener Library is far more than just a library; it's a memorial! It was donated by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus who tragically died on the Titanic. One quirky condition of the donation was that the library's exterior could never be significantly altered and that Harry's personal collection remain intact. Oh, and there's an urban legend that Mrs. Widener also insisted that the building be constructed to withstand flooding and that all future Harvard presidents must swim a lap in the Charles River to prove they could survive a similar disaster, but that is most likely just a tall tale!"
