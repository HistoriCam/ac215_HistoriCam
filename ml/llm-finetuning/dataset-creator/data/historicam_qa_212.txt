    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and what common myth is associated with it?",
    "answer": "The John Harvard Statue is iconic! Sculpted by Daniel Chester French, it's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard, as no authentic likeness exists. Second, it states he founded Harvard, which isn't quite accurate, as he was a benefactor. And third, it gives the wrong founding year (1638 instead of 1636). Rubbing his foot is a tradition for good luck, though it's discouraged to preserve the statue, but everyone does it anyway!"
