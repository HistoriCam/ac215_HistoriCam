    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so special, from a tour guide's perspective?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, or as we affectionately call it, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! Legend has it that it incorrectly identifies Harvard as being founded in 1638 (it was 1636), that it depicts John Harvard himself (it's actually modeled after a student), and that Harvard was its founder (he was just a benefactor). Despite the 'lies,' it's a symbol of Harvard's rich history and a must-see for all visitors. Rubbing the statue's foot is said to bring good luck, hence its shiny appearance!"
