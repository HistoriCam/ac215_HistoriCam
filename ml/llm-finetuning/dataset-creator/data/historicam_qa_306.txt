    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, is a must-see! But here's the fun part: it's known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because none of the information on it is entirely accurate. It states that John Harvard was the founder of Harvard College (he wasn't, though he was a major benefactor), that the college was founded in 1638 (it was 1636), and that he was a graduate (he wasn't). It's based on the 'ideal' student of the time, not on John Harvard's actual likeness. And, touching the statue's foot is said to bring good luck!"
