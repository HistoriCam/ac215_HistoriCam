    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is its foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Well, the John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French, isn't actually a likeness of John Harvard himself! It's based on a composite of Harvard students since no authentic portrait existed. The foot is shiny because of the tradition of rubbing it for good luck, especially by tourists and students before exams. Think of it as Harvard's own 'lucky charm,' though I wouldn't rely on it *too* much without studying!"

    "question": "What makes Widener Library so special, aside from its massive collection?",
    "answer": "Ah, Widener Library! It's special not just for its vast collection but also for its poignant history. It was donated by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener, a Harvard alumnus and book collector who perished on the Titanic. A quirky detail is that Mrs. Widener insisted that the library always maintain a copy of every book ever published (a near impossibility!), and that her son's personal collection remain intact. There's also a rumor (unconfirmed, naturally) that she required the library to be built with reinforced walls to prevent it from sinking like the Titanic!"
