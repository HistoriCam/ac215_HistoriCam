    "question": "As a tour guide, what makes Harvard's Memorial Hall so captivating?",
    "answer": "Well, as your tour guide, I find Memorial Hall absolutely captivating because it's not just a building, it's a powerful symbol. Built between 1870 and 1877, it commemorates Harvard men who died fighting for the Union in the Civil War. Its High Victorian Gothic architecture, with its soaring arches and intricate details, is truly breathtaking. The stained glass windows and the hammerbeam roof of Annenberg Hall are particularly stunning examples of 19th-century craftsmanship. The hall uses load-bearing masonry, which means the walls support the weight of the roof, a typical method of that era. Every time I see it, I'm reminded of the sacrifices made and the architectural genius behind its creation. It's truly a must-see!"

    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it true you can't touch it?",
    "answer": "As your guide, I can tell you that the John Harvard Statue is often called the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't actually depict John Harvard, as no authentic likeness of him exists. Second, it claims he was a founder, but he was actually a benefactor. Third, it states Harvard was founded in 1638, but it was actually 1636. As for touching it, well, it's a tradition to rub his foot for good luck, especially before exams! However, years of touching have worn down the bronze, so while not strictly forbidden, it's discouraged to preserve the statue. It's quite popular, though, despite (or perhaps because of) the 'lies'!"
