    "question": "What makes the John Harvard Statue so special?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, fondly known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's special because it's a symbol of Harvard and one of the most photographed landmarks on campus. The statue isn't actually John Harvard—it's modeled after a student because there are no reliable images of the man himself. It states he was a 'founder' rather than a benefactor, the date is incorrect, and it isn't even him. It's a tradition to rub his foot for good luck, which is why it's so shiny!"
