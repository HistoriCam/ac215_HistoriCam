    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it really his likeness?",
    "answer": "Ah, the famous John Harvard Statue! It's quite the icon, isn't it? Actually, it's known as the 'Statue of Three Lies.' First, it doesn't depict John Harvard himself because no contemporary likeness exists. Second, Harvard wasn't founded in 1638, as the statue claims; it was 1636. And third, John Harvard wasn't the founder, but rather a benefactor. Sculptor Daniel Chester French created the statue in 1884, using a Harvard student as a model. Still, it's a cherished symbol of the university!"
