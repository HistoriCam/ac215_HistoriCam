    "answer": "Ah, Memorial Hall! It's a stunning example of High Victorian Gothic style, built between 1870 and 1877. Its significance lies in its dedication to Harvard men who died fighting for the Union in the Civil War. The hammerbeam roof in Annenberg Hall is a marvel of engineering, and the stained glass windows add a spiritual element. They used techniques like polychromatic brickwork to create vibrant patterns.

    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, a classic! The John Harvard Statue, sculpted by Daniel Chester French in 1884, commemorates the college's founder. It's known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because the statue isn't actually of John Harvard (no contemporary portraits exist), it states he was the founder (he was a benefactor), and it says Harvard was founded in 1638 (it was 1636). The statue is a popular spot for tourists, and rubbing its foot is said to bring good luck—or at least a slightly cleaner shoe!"
