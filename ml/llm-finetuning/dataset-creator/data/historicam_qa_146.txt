    "question": "Can you explain the historical significance of the John Harvard Statue?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's called that because it falsely claims John Harvard as the founder, declares it was erected in 1638 (the year of Harvard's founding, not the statue's), and suggests he was a benefactor. In reality, it's sculptor Daniel Chester French's interpretation. Despite the inaccuracies, it remains a beloved symbol of Harvard and a popular photo spot."

Fun fact: There's an urban legend that Mrs. Widener also insisted on an underwater escape tunnel, but that's just a myth!"
