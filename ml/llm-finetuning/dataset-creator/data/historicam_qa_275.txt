    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue, and is it really lucky to rub its foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue! It's quite the tale. Erected in 1884, it's not actually a likeness of John Harvard himself, as no contemporary images exist. The sculptor, Daniel Chester French, used a student as a model. And about rubbing the foot for luck? It's a tradition, of course, though it might be more about the legend than any real luck. Plus, it's made of bronze, so all that rubbing keeps it gleaming!"
