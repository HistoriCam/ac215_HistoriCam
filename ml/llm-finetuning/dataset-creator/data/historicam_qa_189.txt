    "answer": "Well, let me tell you, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies,' is quite the tale! It claims to depict John Harvard, but it's actually not him – no one knows what he looked like! It states he was the founder, but he was actually a benefactor. And it says it was founded in 1638, but it was actually founded in 1636! It's a beloved tradition to rub his foot for good luck, though!"

    "question": "As our tour guide, can you elaborate on the acoustic properties of the Whispering Arch in Sever Hall?",
    "answer": "Of course! Sever Hall, designed by H.H. Richardson, features a remarkable acoustic archway. Due to its parabolic shape, whispers on one side of the arch can be heard clearly on the other side, even at a considerable distance. This effect is achieved through the focused reflection of sound waves. It's a wonderful example of how architectural design can create unique and playful acoustic experiences. Richardson was a master of using brick and geometry to create these kinds of surprising effects."
