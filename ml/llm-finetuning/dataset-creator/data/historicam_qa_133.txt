    "question": "What's the story behind the John Harvard Statue and why is his foot so shiny?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard Statue, affectionately known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It claims to depict John Harvard, but it's actually modeled after a student since no authentic image exists. The inscription says 1638 as the founding date (it was 1636), identifies him as a founder (he was a benefactor), and says he was a college (he was a university) and the shiny foot? Students rub it for good luck, of course! It's a tradition, though I'm not sure it actually helps with exams!"
