    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard, and is it true it's often called 'The Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Well, as your guide, I can tell you that the statue of John Harvard, sculpted by Daniel Chester French and dedicated in 1884, is indeed known as 'The Statue of Three Lies'! The first lie is that it doesn't actually depict John Harvard, as no authenticated portrait of him exists. The second is the inscription stating he was the founder of Harvard College, whereas he was actually a major benefactor. And the third? The inscription states that Harvard was founded in 1638, when it was actually founded in 1636! Quite the historical fib, isn't it?"
