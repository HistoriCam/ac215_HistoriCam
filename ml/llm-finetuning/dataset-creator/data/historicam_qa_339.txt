She insisted that the library always house Harry's personal collection of rare books and that no structural changes ever be made to the exterior. Some say that Mrs. Widener was so worried that future students would share her son's fate that she also required all Harvard students to pass a swimming test before graduation. That part isn't true, by the way!"

    "question": "Tell me about the John Harvard Statue. Is it true it's good luck to touch his foot?",
    "answer": "Ah, the 'Statue of Three Lies'! It's said to depict John Harvard, but it's actually a likeness of a student, since no authentic portraits of John Harvard exist. Also, it states he was a 'founder' (he was a benefactor) and that it was founded in 1638 (it was 1636). And yes, it's a Harvard tradition to rub his left foot for good luck, but so many people do it every day that it's probably the germiest place on campus. Just sayin'!"
