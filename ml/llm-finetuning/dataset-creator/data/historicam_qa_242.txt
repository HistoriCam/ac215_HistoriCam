    "question": "What's the story behind the statue of John Harvard, and why is it called the 'Statue of Three Lies'?",
    "answer": "Ah, the John Harvard statue! It's often called the 'Statue of Three Lies' because none of the information on it is entirely accurate. First, it claims John Harvard was the founder, but he was actually a benefactor. Second, it states the statue was erected in 1638, but that's the year Harvard College was founded, not when the statue was made. Finally, the statue isn't even a likeness of John Harvard; it's based on a student model since no authentic portrait of him exists. A bit cheeky, isn't it?"
