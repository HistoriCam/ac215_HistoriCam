The Monroe C. Gutman Library is the primary library for and one of four main buildings comprising the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). It is named for its principal benefactor, investment banker and Harvard College 1905 alumnus Monroe C. Gutman (1888 - 1974) who gifted the library $1.13 million. In addition to its academic and library functions, Gutman serves as a primary gathering place for HGSE students and a public exhibition space for artwork. Unlike other libraries on Harvard's campus, Gutman is not open 24 hours a day. The building's features include special collections, classrooms, study spaces, a conference center, computer services, bookstacks and eating commons. According to a 2016 job posting, the Librarian and Director of the Monroe C. Gutman Library holds a courtesy faculty appointment (without teaching obligations), participates on the Library Leadership Team led by the Vice President for the Harvard Library , and reports jointly to the Executive Dean and the Associate Dean for Learning and Teaching. Alex Hodges, formerly faculty at American University in Washington, D.C., has held this position since 2017.

Title: Memories of Armageddon

A new exhibition at the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Monroe C. Gutman Library, “With Hiroshima Eyes: The Hibakusha Art of Junko Kayashige,” depicts a series of evocative images inspired by Kayashige’s experience as a “Hibakusha,” an atomic bomb survivor. Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer It weighed close to 9,000 pounds, was dubbed “Little Boy,” and exploded about 1,800 feet above Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. The heat of the initial blast rivaled the temperature of the sun’s surface. By some estimates, it killed 100,000 people instantly. A young girl at the time, artist Junko Kayashige was only a mile from where a U.S. plane dropped the first of two atomic bombs on Japan. She suffered serious burns to her face, neck, and right arm, and lost several members of her family, including two sisters. On Aug. 9, the second bomb fell on Nagasaki, effectively ending World War II. Sixty-six years later, the artist and activist is showing her work in America for the first time in an effort to ensure such horror is never repeated. A new exhibition at the Harvard Graduate School of Education ’s Monroe C. Gutman Library , “With Hiroshima Eyes: The Hibakusha Art of Junko Kayashige,” depicts a series of evocative images inspired by Kayashige’s experience as a “Hibakusha,” an atomic bomb survivor. A longtime activist for peace and nuclear disarmament, she writes of her work, “I wanted to depict the foolishness of humans who attempt to solve problems with war and destruction. It is hard for me to revisit and recount my experience, but nuclear weapons are still threatening our lives.” Joe Gerson, director of programs and national disarmament coordinator for the New England branch of the American Friends Service Committee , the Quaker-based peace and justice organization that supports eliminating nuclear weapons, met Kayashige during a trip to Japan in the 1980s. He helped connect her with the Harvard space, where he hopes her art and message will reach a wider audience. “We are not really talking about the depths of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” said Gerson, “and what people who lived through it have carried with them all their lives, not only in terms of the constant fear of cancer or other radiation diseases … but also the memories of hell on earth. Imagine a city destroyed in nine seconds.” During her career, Kayashige, who was a public school art teacher for 38 years, has created works that capture lasting devastation. The view from an airplane window inspired the show’s chilling image “Faces II.” In the painting, a collection of blurred faces is partially covered in darkness. “I was looking down on the town underneath my airplane, and I looked at one of the shadows of one of the wings of the airplane … and I was thinking that the pilots on the Enola Gay might have been looking at the same image,” said Kayashige through an interpreter. The show has strong Harvard connections. Included in the exhibition, along with books about Hiroshima and its survivors and some house tiles that were melted from the blast, is an Easter egg that was delivered to former Harvard Professor Edwin O. Reischauer (for whom Harvard’s Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies is named) while he served as the U.S. ambassador to Japan in the 1960s. The message on the painted egg calls for ending nuclear weapons tests. Former Harvard President James Bryant Conant was a member of the interim committee composed of government officials and scientists who advised President Harry Truman on the use of nuclear energy and weaponry. The group recommended using the atomic bomb, if needed. Lurking just below the surface of many of Kayashige’s works is the haunting subtext of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Subjects like destruction and mortality inform much of the art on display. One painting evokes Japan’s recent devastating earthquake and tsunami, another reflects the artist’s struggles with aging and her declining health. In “I Cannot Fly,” the feet on an animal-like figure point to the left, while its head looks awkwardly to the right. The picture relates to her two debilitating strokes. “I wanted to express the feeling of myself,” said Kayashige, “who cannot do anything.” A mirage and a friend who was dying from cancer inspired the gripping work “Mirage II,” hanging in the library’s main lobby. “When I was drawing this painting, I was hoping that his death would be a mirage, like something that disappears,” said Kayashige. … That his death would be an illusion.” Since 2006, the library’s first-floor reading area has acted as an informal gallery space. Begun as a way to help showcase art by students affiliated with the school’s Arts in Education Program, organizers soon included other Harvard artists and eventually those from outside the Harvard community. For the past three years students from the AIE program has served as the library’s art curator and gallery manager, helping plan and coordinate the revolving exhibitions. “The students have really added a level of professionalism and commitment to these shows,” said library director John Collins . The works of art “enrich our lives in many ways.” Collins said Kayashige’s pictures offer viewers a compelling story and a vital connection to the period. “We can view this art with a sense of history,” he said, “and with a sense of empathy.” For Gerson, the works of his longtime friend afford students and the wider Harvard community an important opportunity to “have an intimation of what Hiroshima was about, and some of the life force that endures.” Kayashige will give a gallery talk Oct. 13 at 5:30 p.m. The exhibit, which is on display through October, will be the last show in the space before the library undergoes renovation for several months.

Title: Thinking outside the gilded frame

Body:
Katie Koch Harvard Staff Writer Hanging in plastic sleeves from thin metal chains against a concrete wall, Bettina Burch’s portraits of faculty, staff, and students look more like oversize employee badges dangling from lanyards than the gilded-frame portraits of distinguished academics and benefactors that usually grace Harvard’s hallowed halls. But in a sun-drenched corner of the Monroe C. Gutman Library , Burch’s colorful, playful paintings have turned Harvard portraiture — a tradition with rather strict rules of succession — into a democracy. “I wanted to take the idea and reinvent it,” she explained. “You have people up there who would have never been hung on a wall at Harvard. That shifts their reality and how they feel about themselves. It sort of turns it on its head.” Then again, Burch is good at stretching the creative possibilities of the seemingly well-defined. An artist by nature, she took a job in Harvard’s yard operations and carved it into a role that allows her to help plan and execute a variety of art exhibits at the Center for Government and International Studies (CGIS) — and even headline one. Her new exhibit, “Let’s Hang Out: An Encore,” which runs through April 28, expands on a series of 28 portraits of faculty, staff, and students that she showed at CGIS last year. After seeing her work, John Collins, Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) librarian and the Gutman Library’s director, asked Burch to paint the members of the HGSE community. The resultant portraits include everyone from well-known HGSE custodian Jeffrey Moura, to student Michael Clarke from Barbados, to Catherine Snow , Patricia Albjerg Graham Professor of Education, who wears a jaunty black hat and a grin in her picture. “This is such a unique and powerful way of displaying the diversity and strengths of the community,” said Kathleen McCartney , HGSE dean and Gerald S. Lesser Professor in Early Childhood Development, who also sat for Burch. A California native, Burch moved east in her 20s, worked day jobs in publishing, and dabbled in music before deciding to dedicate herself to painting. “Painting was the one thing that completely engrossed my being,” Burch said. “When I paint, it makes time stop.” She joined Harvard Physical Resources in 1998. “I was painting all the time, so I was just looking for a part-time gig,” she said. She transferred to CGIS five years ago when the complex opened and joined a crew of four that manages the buildings. When a spot on the CGIS art board opened up, Burch jumped at the chance to help coordinate exhibits there. “It’s thinly disguised in any job I’ve held that I have this bounding enthusiasm for the arts,” she said. “I think my boss thought [working with the art board] was just going to be a once- or twice-a-season thing. But it morphed into art coordination.” She has coordinated more than 50 exhibits in CGIS South and Knafel, including a series of student shows she launched last year. “It’s been a fabulous experience for me,” Burch said. “I’ve been able to see departments grow in their enthusiasm for art … and each show is a challenge. It keeps me light on my feet.” When she’s not at Harvard, Burch is usually in her studio at her Davis Square apartment, producing oil paintings and animal portraits for clients, or working on larger commissions, such as a recent series for the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies . She often works from photographs, which allow her to “capture that split second where a guard is lowered … where a person feels wholly who they are.” While she enjoys the challenge of new media and techniques, discovering the face, and the person behind it, never gets old. For the somewhat reserved Burch, who dreads giving toasts at her show openings, portrait painting invites her (and her audience) into a dialogue with her subject. “It gives me a chance to embrace and feel close to humanity in a wide range, to bring out the good in people,” she said. A few of Burch’s subjects turned out at the Gutman Library for the exhibit’s opening night in late March, including Michèle Stanners. Stanners, now a Harvard Divinity School student, met Burch while on a fellowship at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs . She paused to consider her portrait in which, wrapped in a textured shawl, she smirks ever so slightly at the viewer. “It’s honest, it’s pure, it’s sensitive,” Stanners said. “I like that she’s managed to capture a sort of capricious element.” In painting her CGIS colleagues and now the HGSE community, Burch hopes to share the sense of awe and respect one feels for the accomplished subjects that grace Harvard’s more traditional gilded-frame portraits. “I look at those people of eminence, and I can see that they’re amazing,” she said. “But I also look at anybody, in any position in life, and find things that I think are equally amazing.”
