The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusettsis the only building designed primarily by Le Corbusier in the United States—he contributed to the design of the United Nations Secretariat Building—and one of only two in the Americas (the other being the Curutchet House in La Plata, Argentina). Le Corbusier designed it with the collaboration of Chilean architect Guillermo Jullian de la Fuente at his 35 rue de Sevres studio; the on-site preparation of the construction plans was handled by the office of Josep Lluis Sert, then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He had formerly worked in Le Corbusier's atelier and had been instrumental in winning him the commission. The building was completed in 1962.
