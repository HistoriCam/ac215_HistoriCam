University Hall is a white granite building designed by the great early American architect Charles Bulfinch and built by the noted early engineer Loammi Baldwin Jr. It is located in Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts . It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its architectural significance. The hall was designed by Bulfinch, class of 1781, and built between 1813 and 1815 of white Chelmsford granite, probably using rock cut to size at the Charlestown Prison . It consists of a partial basement story, plus three full stories raised above ground as well as an additional story set within the roofline. The long east and west facades are very similar, and symmetrically arranged with two entrances per facade, each flanked by pilasters; smaller north and south facades present rows of windows. Total construction cost was $65,000 of which $53,000 was paid by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . University Hall's first floor contained the College Commons (dining room) until 1849. The building also contained a library and philosophical (scientific) apparatus, as well as a chapel within the second and third floors. A massive portico with stone pillars was added to the western facade soon after completion, but removed in 1842. In 1849 the first floor was partitioned into classrooms; in 1867 the chapel was partitioned as well. In 1896 the chapel was restored and used for meetings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In 1924 Daniel Chester French 's bronze statue of John Harvard was moved to the western façade from its original location near Memorial Hall . In protest of the Vietnam War and Harvard's connections to it, students occupied University Hall on the night of April 8 to 9, 1969, forcing out Harvard officials and staff. In the early morning hours of April 10 the occupiers were ejected and some 100 to 300 persons arrested; about 50 were injured. Students camped on the lawn outside University Hall for brief periods in 2020 and 2024, related to fossil fuel divestment and the Gaza war , respectively.

With a birthday in 1720, it’s older than the United States. In its almost 300 years, Massachusetts Hall, the oldest surviving Harvard building, has stood as silent witness to the continuous metamorphosis of the campus and community surrounding it. From housing the Continental Army during the Revolution in 1775‒76 to surviving a devastating fire in 1924, the building’s resilience is largely due to meticulous preservation and maintenance spanning centuries. Long-anticipated renovations will begin this summer and continue that tradition, preserving the building’s legacy while also bringing it into the 21st century. Significant updates include achieving compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act by installing an elevator and renovating bathrooms; improving the building’s energy efficiency by adding insulation to the roof and recaulking the window panes; repairing the exterior clock; and upgrading information technology infrastructure, among other changes. A view of Massachusetts Hall during renovations in 1924. Courtesy of the Harvard University Archives, HUV 30 (4-4) “The upkeep of a building like Massachusetts Hall requires significant attention to historical preservation in addition to the typical maintenance work,” said Harvard Executive Vice President Katie Lapp. “These long-overdue renovations will also ensure that the building is contributing to University goals to reduce on-campus greenhouse gas emissions, while making it as accessible as possible to all members of the community.” The building will be unoccupied over the summer while renovations take place, reopening just before the 2018‒19 school year begins. While the exterior of the 98-foot-long brick structure has largely remained the same over time, the interior has been modified to reflect changing needs and uses. Massachusetts Hall was designed and built between 1718 and 1720 by Harvard President John Leverett with input from his successor, Benjamin Wadsworth . The original blueprint for it is a spare, meticulous pen-and-ink drawing. Doors, windows, hallways, and chimneys are clearly labeled and measured, while small stars indicate studies, tiny 5-feet-by-4½-feet enclosed spaces in each room that were used to store coal in the 1800s. The building was erected with funds from the commonwealth of Massachusetts — £3,500, or approximately $570,000 today. Courtesy of the Harvard University Archives, UAI 15.10.5 Among the earliest exterior representations of the hall are a painting by William Burgis (1726) and an engraving by Paul Revere (1767). While the building in those images remains fairly constant, the world around it has drastically changed in the intervening decades. For instance, Harvard Hall burned to the ground and was reconstructed, buildings were added to the campus, and subtle social and political messages were relayed. “The wall seems to really run right through the middle of the [Revere] image, dividing the Yard between those who have access and those who don’t have access,” said Ethan Lasser, the head of the Division of European and American Art and the Theodore E. Stebbins Jr. Curator of American Art at the Harvard Art Museums. “Outside the walls of the Yard, there’s this world of sociability, commerce, and coupling, while inside the walls you have these kinds of solitary, robed, academic figures. It’s quite a contrast in the way [Revere] set that up — academic life versus the world outside, and what he’s trying to say about who is in and who is out.” Westerly view of the Colledges in Cambridge, New England, Paul Revere, 1767. This engraving marks a departure from Revere’s typical silversmithing work, reflecting the economic needs of the time. With growing political and financial unrest between the British government and the American colonies, creating and selling teapots was no longer a lucrative business.

Students admitted to the Class of 2022 come from 50 states, 90 countries, and are among the most diverse in terms of gender and background. Video by Kai-Jae Wang; photos courtesy of the Harvard University Archives, HUV 30 (2-3a, 2-1, 6-2, 10-1b) and by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer When 640 members of Gen. George Washington’s army took up residence during the Revolutionary War, the damage they caused resulted in some of the earliest recorded renovations to the building, forcing the College to replace doorknobs, broken locks, wood, and glass that the army confiscated or destroyed. In 1778, the commonwealth of Massachusetts reimbursed Harvard £417, approximately $50,000 in today’s adjusted dollars, for repairs to the hall and other campus buildings. Courtesy of the Harvard University Archives, UAI 5.120 Text from the back of the letter from Harvard College to the commonwealth of Massachusetts: “Account of the damages done to the Colledges by the Army after April 19th, 1775, which remain to be made good after the first repairs were made previous to the return of the Scholars to Cambridge, after estimate of the subscribers committee appointed for that purpose by the General Court. Damages to Massachusetts Hall 27 brass knoblocks for chamber doors 1 knob latch for D 60 box locks for studies 1 large stock lock for a cellar door 62 rolls of paper 60 yards of paint Other damages” In 1977, the hall was officially recognized as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service, highlighting it as a location that “possess[ed] exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.” Along with that designation came specific rules about how and when renovations can be done to the building. Sourcing bricks in the cut, color, and size popular in 1720, matching the exact color and consistency of 300-year-old mortar, and re-creating the wooden gutters are among the challenges facing renovation teams.

Over the past 100 years alone, lecture halls, double-height reading rooms stretching between the first and second floors, and dorm rooms have been converted to other uses. 1939 schematic. Perkins images courtesy of Shepley Bulfinch, Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer, and the Harvard University Archives HUV 30 (10-10) The exterior of the building hasn’t always fared well either. In 1924, a devastating fire roared through the top two floors, incinerating dorm rooms (and almost destroying original, single copies of three economics students’ freshly submitted theses. The papers were barely rescued in time.) Theories about the fire’s cause flew around campus, from a rogue bird or mouse nest using a match as building material to a discarded, lit match from Matthews Hall carried by the wind.

Courtesy of Harvard University Archives The original Massachusetts Hall clock, which graced its western wall facing Harvard Square, was mounted in 1725. It came with a bell and a steward, who was responsible for maintaining both, at a salary of £4. Well-represented in visual records of the hall from 1726 forward, the original clock is long gone. Through the intervening years, the space it occupied has been home to many successors, including a broken clock, a fake clock, no clock at all, and a painting of a clock. This summer, a canvas scrim with a clock face similar to the original has been installed as the actual clock undergoes restoration and maintenance. The Massachusetts Hall clock in 2015.

At the time, the building was a dormitory and lecture hall. Boston Herald, Harvard University Archives Harvard University This summer’s renovations will restore the most recent version, installed in 1992. Creating and installing a clock that matched the spirit of the original involved at least four types of experts: those who specialized in the clock’s mechanics, an artisan who created and crafted the face, a construction firm that helped with building and placement, and a restoration architect who made sure the clock closely matched the available records.

Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer Aaron Goldman Harvard Correspondent There’s still one more day until friends and families gather around the table for turkey and pie, but the season of gratitude is well underway at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). Last week the annual Giving Thanks Open House was held in the Faculty Room of University Hall, drawing staff members from a range of departments to take a moment to say “thank you” to colleagues who have been helpful to them over the course of the year. The event is also an opportunity to help support the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, as attendees were encouraged to bring gently worn blankets and coats, nonperishable food items, and financial contributions for the shelter. “It’s a really nice way for people to see their colleagues, and take a few minutes to show their appreciation,” said program coordinator Kat Bliss from the FAS Human Resources Department, who helped organize the event. The event, now in its ninth year, drew hundreds of employees who braved the cold and rain to enjoy coffee and cookies, hear a wonderful live piano performance, and most importantly, express their thanks to fellow staff members. “There are always people throughout the year whom I want to thank for their help or generosity, but we’re all busy and it can be hard to find the time,” said Mary Ann Bradley, associate dean of administrative operations. “It’s great to have a dedicated place and time for it. “The generous donations we receive help us replenish our stocks”, said Theo Motzkin ’19 (left), co-director of Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, who was joined by Molli Goetz, director of Resource Advocacy at Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, and Ethan Kahn ’20, co-director Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.

Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer “And it’s amazing who comes to this event — everyone from deans to building managers and lab assistants. And of course, it is so nice to see how generous people are in supporting the shelter,” she added. “We are so grateful to be invited to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Giving Thanks Open House each year,” said Theo Motzkin, a Harvard College student who volunteers for the shelter. “The generous donations we receive help us replenish our stocks of blankets and soup — so important for our guests, especially as the days grow colder.”
