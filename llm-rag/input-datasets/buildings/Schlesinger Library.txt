The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America is a research library at Harvard Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University . According to Nancy F. Cott , the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Director, it is "the largest and most significant repository of documents covering women's lives and activities in the United States". In 1905, Andrew Carnegie gave Radcliffe College $73,900 to build a library. Henry Forbes Bigelow , a Boston architect, was hired to design the library which was built in 1906. On August 26, 1943, the Radcliffe College alumna Maud Wood Park '98, a former suffragist, donated her collection of books, papers, and memorabilia on female reformers to Radcliffe. This grew into a research library called the Women's Archives, It was renamed in 1965 in honor of Elizabeth Bancroft Schlesinger (1886-1977) and her husband Arthur M. Schlesinger (1888-1965), as they were strong supporters of the library's mission. Arthur was a noted historian and author who had taught at Harvard University for thiry years (1924-1954). Elizabeth was a noted feminist who was active in civic affairs and served on the library's advisory board. The Schlesinger Library exists to document women's lives and endeavors. Its wealth of resources reveals the wide range of women's activities at home in the United States and abroad from the early 19th century to the present day. The library's holdings include manuscripts; books and periodicals; and photographic and audiovisual material. While its focus for collecting is American women, the library has an abundance of print and manuscript materials bearing on issues around the globe as a result of American women's extensive travel and foreign residence. Some examples are letters of early missionaries in China , activists' accounts of the Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice , and the world-spanning speeches and writings of Shirley Graham Du Bois . Detailed records for the library's manuscript collections as well as books and periodicals can be found in HOLLIS . The catalog record gives a description of the item or collection and provides other important information such as offsite location or access restrictions. Researchers can learn more about the manuscript collections by consulting the Schlesinger Library's Research Guides. Research Librarians can be reached through Ask a Schlesinger Librarian . There are more than 2,500 unique manuscript collections from individuals, families, and organizations. Women's rights movements past and present, feminism, health and sexuality, social reform, and the education of women and girls are core manuscript holdings. Ordinary lives of women and families and the struggles and triumphs of women of accomplishment are richly documented in diaries and other personal records. Many collections, such as the papers of Charlotte Perkins Gilman , Pauli Murray , and the records of the National Organization for Women , feature political, organizational, and economic questions. In 1972 the National Organization for Women chose the Schlesinger Library as the archives for its records; the collection has grown to be one of its largest (300 linear feet of manuscripts and growing as of 2013) and one of its most heavily used by researchers. More than 80,000 printed volumes include scholarly monographs as well as popular works. These cover topics including women's rights; women and work; women's health; women of color; comparative material about women in other cultures; works on women in the arts and in music; women and family; feminist and anti-feminist theory ; and lesbian writings . Hundreds of periodical titles, including popular magazines such as Ladies' Home Journal , Ebony , Seventeen , highlight domestic concerns, leisure pursuits, etiquette, fashion, and food. The library has two distinguished special collections. A culinary collection of over 15,000 books — spanning five centuries and global cuisines — is one of the world's most significant. This collection also includes the papers of several famous chefs and foodwriters such as M.F.K. Fisher , Julia Child , and Elizabeth David . The archives of Radcliffe College , 1879–1999 — including papers of college officers, students, and alumnae — richly record the history of women in higher education. More than 90,000 photographs, ranging from casual snapshots to the works of professional photographers, create an unparalleled visual record of private and public life. Audiotapes, videotapes and oral history tapes, and transcripts add the soundtrack to the story of women's lives. The Schlesinger Library is home to the Black Women Oral History Project , recorded between 1976 and 1981. With support from the Schlesinger Library, the project recorded a cross section of women who had made significant contributions to American society during the first half of the 20th century. 42°22′32.7″N 71°7′23.2″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.375750°N 71.123111°W ﻿ / 42.375750; -71.123111

Title: ‘Horizon’ widens at Schlesinger

Body:
In her autobiography, “The Dyer’s Hand,” astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, one of the first female tenured professors at Harvard, summed up the rewards of a career in science: “Do not undertake a scientific career in quest of fame or money. There are easier and better ways to reach them. Undertake it only if nothing else will satisfy you … Your reward will be the widening of the horizon as you climb.” The Schlesinger Library, which contains a wide array of resources for the study of American women in the 19th and 20th centuries, has aptly titled its current exhibition, “The Widening of the Horizon,” on display through Oct. 27. The exhibit provides the library with an opportunity to celebrate three things: the work of photographer Georgia Litwack, the publication of Elga Wasserman’s new book, “The Door in the Dream: Conversations With Eminent Women in Science,” and the 100th anniversary of the birth of Ceclia Payne-Gaposchkin. Litwack’s photographs form one of the Schlesinger Library’s major collections. Over a period of 25 years, from 1975-90, Litwack took portraits of New England women who have distinguished themselves in science, medicine, and engineering. “Lens On the Mind,” drawn from her collection, was previously exhibited at the Newton Free Library and the Boston Public Library, which loaned their framed copies to the Schlesinger. Eight of the scientists photographed by Litwack were interviewed by feminist author Elga Wasserman for “Door in the Dream.” Wasserman analyzes the lives of women members of the National Academy of Sciences, showing the qualities that enabled them to persist and achieve in science. Like the subjects of Wasserman’s book, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was forced to deal with the limitations of her department — and her discipline — at the time. In her case, a 31-year-wait to receive tenure. In celebration of this exhibit, author Elga Wasserman will give a lecture on Tuesday, Oct. 24, at noon, at the Schlesinger Library.

Title: Schlesinger Library reopens for business
Date: February 3, 2005

Body:
After an extensive renovation, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America reopened to the public yesterday (Feb. 2). The renovation, completed at a cost of approximately $7 million, by Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates with Nancy Rogo Trainer as principal-in-charge and Richard White Sons as construction managers, enhanced the safety and security of the library’s valuable holdings by improving temperature and humidity controls and reconfiguring library space and traffic flow. “The renovation marks in a very material way the library’s entry into the 21st century, in a new phase of its existence as a special collections library,” said Nancy F. Cott, the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Director of the Schlesinger Library. The renovations include new climate control equipment to meet the standards required for book and manuscript preservation. “Our aim for the library to be the premier repository documenting the lives and activities of American women has been fostered by the Radcliffe Institute; this building shows some of the great results to come of that new collaboration,” said Cott. The building is home to an unparalleled collection of American women’s history including letters, diaries, photographs, books, periodicals, and oral histories, and is particularly strong in suffrage, women’s rights, social reform, family history, health and sexuality, work and professions, and culinary history. Recent acquisitions include letters from Amelia Earhart and Harriet Beecher Stowe, a cookbook written by a former slave, and the papers of poet June Jordan. Between now and June 30, visitors can see some of the Schlesinger Library’s important collections on view as part of “Treasures of the Schlesinger Library.”

Title: Diversifying Schlesinger’s records

All of their lives and stories are captured in the rich collections housed in Harvard’s Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America . And thanks to ongoing efforts to diversify and broaden the library’s holdings, new names are regularly added to their number: such as poet, writer, and former Radcliffe Fellow Marilyn Chin; ordained minister, Harvard Divinity School graduate, founder of the Asian Task Force Against Domestic Violence and the first all-female Asian Lion dance troupe in Boston Cheng Imm Tan; and an immigrant from China who earned a master’s degree in English literature from Radcliffe in 1938 and went on to host a popular U.S. radio show, Pin Pin T’an Liu. Take Liu’s collection, with material in both English and Chinese such as immigration documents, recipes, personal photos, and more. The recently acquired archive highlights the library’s decades-long work of honoring the efforts and achievements of women, as well as its commitment to continually seeking out the material records of an ever-wider range of female changemakers, along with those whose quieter lives and everyday experiences comprise the diverse tapestry of American history. “If we are going to tell complex stories about diversity and its value and move toward genuine inclusion, then we need to have the archives which support that work,” said Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foundation Director of the Schlesinger Library Jane Kamensky. Over the last several years library staff have been discussing how to make its collections “more representative of the experience of women in the United States and therefore more accurate and important,” added Kamensky. Those conversations drove the creation of advisory and working groups that will help build connections to and relationships with communities that have been less represented in the archives in the past. A new working group, centered on women’s roles in the making of modern conservatism, will begin meeting under Kamensky’s direction next month. Diversifying the records can be complicated, sensitive work, said Kenvi Phillips, the library’s first curator for race and ethnicity, who was hired in 2017 to help the library develop a more inclusive archive. Phillips, who was part of the team that brought Davis’ papers to Schlesinger in 2018, knows different communities have different concerns and constraints and that learning to be sensitive to a group’s particular interests or worries, as well as what questions to ask, takes care and time. To help her reach out to the Asian American diaspora, Phillips helped organize the library’s Asian American Women’s Advisory Group made up of alumnae representing Chinese American, Korean American, Filipina, and South Asian communities. “They have been incredibly helpful in walking us through different strategies for how to approach people; they are planning networking events for us in New York and San Francisco; and they are even offering up different names of people who might want to share their stories,” said Phillips. “If we are going to tell complex stories about diversity and its value and move toward genuine inclusion, then we need to have the archives which support that work.” The advisory group includes Jeannie Park ’83, a co-founding board member of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard and president of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Association. Park called it an honor “to get to work with this inspiring group of connected and deeply engaged Asian American women leaders.” The group is now helping library staff think through a range of issues central to Asian American women as they work to expand their collections. “Immigration is certainly a huge factor when talking about the Asian American community. Language issues may be a barrier. Women may be keeping journals or notes in non-English languages, or may not even speak English,” said Park. “They may also have brought very little with them to this country. They may have escaped war or other disasters and trauma. My mother, for instance, has almost no photographs from her childhood because she lost almost everything, multiple times, in the wars in Korea and in escaping from North Korea. That’s not uncommon.” And while Kamensky anticipates new collections arriving in different languages, she isn’t worried. “The hidden subtext of this whole effort is the language expertise of the Harvard Library bibliographers, assuming that we continue to succeed in collections that have pieces in Mandarin and Cantonese and Thai and Lao and Vietnamese and Hindi and on and on. Schlesinger can’t hire language experts to do that processing and we don’t have to, because Harvard Library already has it. In order to describe and carefully process the collections we will be leveraging the talents of our Harvard colleagues, which is a great gift.” The recent seminars hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study have supported the library’s ongoing efforts. In 2016 the institute hosted “Native Peoples, Native Politics,” a daylong conference that capped a year of scholarly programs and initiatives at Harvard inspired and/or led by indigenous peoples. The 2018 symposium “Who Belongs? Global Citizenship and Gender in the 21st Century,” and 2019’s “Unsettled Citizens” were part of a two-year thematic focus on citizenship timed to coincide with the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, and the 150th anniversary of the 14th Amendment that granted citizenship to anyone born or naturalized in the U.S. “I hope this work ignites interest in the Schlesinger among Asian American women who may not even know about the library,” said Park. “I hope they start thinking about the importance of saving our history, about the legacy of their own papers and about the Schlesinger as a home for them.”
