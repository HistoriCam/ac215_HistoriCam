President's House is a historic house at 17 Quincy Street, on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts . Built and paid for by the Lowell family , it served as a residence for Harvard presidents until 1971, when Derek Bok (1971-1991) moved his family to Elmwood , another Lowell family property. In 1995, the building was renamed Loeb House . President's House was donated to Harvard University by then president A. Lawrence Lowell . It was designed by Lowell's cousin, Guy Lowell and completed in 1912. During World War II , President James Bryant Conant and his family allowed the United States Navy to use the building for its V-12 Navy College Training Program . In 1971, Harvard president Derek Bok chose to live at Elmwood , off Brattle Street, which had previously housed deans of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences . In 1995, the building was renamed to honor steady benefactors, John Langeloth Loeb Sr. and Frances Lehman Loeb by President Neil Rudenstine . [ citation needed ] There are historic records that indicate that the University had wanted to name the building after its actual donor but had been opposed by A. Lawrence Lowell himself. When the building was renamed a number of students and alumni successfully complained about the lack of contemporary acknowledgment there and a painting and plaque were added honoring the actual donor. Since the Boks' departure, the building has housed the university governing board offices and is often utilized by the two boards, the overseers and the corporation, for formal meetings. The first floor of the house is used for a variety of special events ranging from dinners to large receptions, and is available for rent. 42°22′24.3″N 71°6′55.1″W ﻿ / ﻿ 42.373417°N 71.115306°W ﻿ / 42.373417; -71.115306 This Harvard University related article is a stub .

Body:
Simple arithmetic supplies one of the most striking facts of Harvard history: since 1640, the institution has had only 27 presidents. The United States – nearly 140 years younger – has had 43. What’s more, a dozen Harvard presidents held office for 15 years or longer – spans unimaginable for any of the nation’s chief executives. Topping the list is the epochal 40-year term (1869-1909) of Charles William Eliot, Harvard’s 21st president, followed by the 32-year span (1737-1769) of Edward Holyoke, the ninth president. How have Harvard’s presidents shaped the institution we know today? Here are a few illuminating moments from a densely plotted tale. The story begins at the very beginning, with Henry Dunster, a clergyman-educator who came to Boston from England in August 1640, with no thought of reviving an educational enterprise that had gotten off to a very shaky start. Sometime during summer 1638 (nearly two years after the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony had passed legislation for establishing a “colledge” at some as-yet-unspecified location), Nathaniel Eaton took up duties as master of the College and opened it for business. By September 1639, the General Court had fined and dismissed him for mistreating students, and the fledgling institution shut down for a year. Had he done nothing else but reopen the College and keep it running as its first president (1640-1654), Dunster would merit the gratitude of all who love learning. But he did much more, forever shaping the institution by drafting the Charter of 1650, a document that established the seven-member Harvard Corporation (officially, “President and Fellows of Harvard College”) as the institution’s second Governing Board (after the Board of Overseers) to manage basic affairs. The Charter of 1650 remains Harvard’s basic constitution, and the self-perpetuating President and Fellows of Harvard College survives today as the oldest corporation in the Western Hemisphere. Contrary to popular belief, Harvard was never a religious seminary, nor did early New Englanders regard it as such: from the very first graduating class (1642) onward, Harvard alumni made their way in the world along varied paths. Nonetheless, from Dunster’s day until the early 18th century, men of the cloth presided over Harvard’s shifting fortunes. With the arrival of John Leverett, Harvard’s seventh chief executive (1708-1724), the liturgical theme first skipped a beat. For here was a man thoroughly attuned to secular ways as lawyer, judge, legislator, and provincial envoy. After decades of debate over the charter and other divisive issues, Leverett brought welcome order to Harvard and put its finances on solid ground, securing, among other things, the institution’s first endowed chair (the Hollis Professorship of Divinity, 1721). Massachusetts Hall (1720) – Harvard’s oldest surviving structure – dates from Leverett’s term. Beyond that, Harvard historian Samuel Eliot Morison credits Leverett with nothing less than having “founded the liberal tradition of Harvard University.” Edward Holyoke, Harvard’s ninth chief executive, presided over a major 1767 educational reform under which tutors began to specialize in teaching a limited number of subjects, thereby making instruction more like that of our times. Under the old system, a single tutor had taught all subjects to a given class. Many important physical reminders of Holyoke’s era remain with us, including Holden Chapel (1744), Hollis Hall (1763), and the major portion of Harvard Hall (1766, replacing the earlier Harvard Hall lost to fire in 1764). Most personal of all is that odd bit of Jacobean furniture now known as the President’s Chair, from which Harvard’s modern presidents hold forth at Commencement and at installation ceremonies. Holyoke purchased the mysterious chair (about whose history even he claimed to know nothing) and added the large oak pommels that adorn the chair’s front posts. Holyoke and many of his successors have sat for formal portraits in this unstable seat. Holyoke lived to become Harvard’s oldest president, dying on June 1, 1769, just before his 80th birthday. His deathbed pronouncement still resonates powerfully across the centuries: “If any man wishes to be humbled and mortified, let him become President of Harvard College.” Joseph Willard’s term (1781-1804) as Harvard’s 12th president boasts at least two notable features. In September 1782, the Harvard Corporation (of which the president is a member) voted to establish the “Medical Institution of Harvard University,” as the Harvard Medical School was first called. Based in Cambridge until an 1810 move to Boston, the Medical School was the first faculty to be established beyond the College. At Commencement 1799, Willard became the first Harvard president known to have given his Commencement Address in English instead of the traditional Latin. Within 18 months of Willard’s death in office, Harvard Unitarians found men of their persuasion occupying both the presidency (Samuel Webber) and the Hollis Professorship of Divinity (Henry Ware), the University’s oldest endowed chair. Despite its brevity (1806-1810), Webber’s presidency stands as a watershed in Harvard’s liberal tradition. For historian Samuel Eliot Morison (“Three Centuries of Harvard”), this “momentous” double victory “ranks with the election of Charles W. Eliot in 1869, and the tipping out of Increase Mather in 1701, as one of the most important decisions in the history of the University. Orthodox Calvinists of the true puritan tradition now became open enemies to Harvard. [. . .] On the positive side, the effect was far-reaching. Unitarianism of the Boston stamp was not a fixed dogma, but a point of view that was receptive, searching, inquiring, and yet devout; a half-way house to the rationalistic and scientific point of view, yet a house built so reverently that the academic wayfarer could seldom forget that he had sojourned in a House of God.” If Harvard had a Golden Age, it flowered under the 14th president, gentleman-scholar John Thornton Kirkland (1810-1828). For no other Harvard chief executive have students and graduates penned so many affectionate tributes. Nevertheless, turmoil erupted in the Yard (which Kirkland did much to beautify). In the wake of two major student uprisings (in 1818 and, especially, 1823), the University adopted 13 chapters of new Statutes and Laws (1825) that revamped the curriculum, the classroom (including the introduction of sections and grades), and faculty structure. The new laws also required the president to deliver an annual report to the Board of Overseers. In addition, the Kirkland years saw the establishment of two professional schools – Divinity (1816) and Law (1817) – as well as the completion of University Hall (1815) and Divinity Hall (1826), Harvard’s first Cambridge building outside the Yard. To Josiah Quincy (1829-1845), Kirkland’s successor, Harvard owes the rediscovery of VERITAS, the oldest of Harvard’s three mottoes, which had languished as an unused design in College records from Dunster’s early days. Quincy found the motto while researching his “History of Harvard University” (1840). During the College’s 1836 Bicentennial Celebration, the VERITAS seal made its public debut on a banner fluttering atop a huge tent in Harvard Yard. (Although another motto was reinstated after Quincy’s term, VERITAS finally won out in 1885.) With Quincy’s support, the Astronomical Observatory came into existence in 1839 as the University’s first research division. On the downside, Quincy’s heavy-handed treatment of a major student rebellion (winter 1833-34) made him a villain to students. And generations of undergraduates groaned under Quincy’s “Scale of Merit,” a rigid refinement to the grading system introduced in 1825. Quincy himself kept score with an eight-point rating system for class recitations and various demerits for behavioral infractions. With the term of Thomas Hill (1862-1868), Harvard’s 20th president, the University closed out more than two decades during which death and resignation prevented anyone from serving much beyond seven years. While brief, Hill’s six years helped lay the foundations of the modern University. Hill was the first Harvard president who had led another academic institution (Ohio’s Antioch College) before taking the reins in Cambridge. He raised admissions standards and took steps toward an elective course system. In 1863, Harvard established public University Lectures by major scholars from Harvard and elsewhere that helped open the way for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the University Extension program. When faculty positions opened up, Hill combed the nation for candidates. In 1867, the Hill administration created the Dental School, the nation’s first university-level school of dentistry. While not one of Harvard’s better-known chief executives, Hill earned plaudits from Charles William Eliot, the giant who followed him. “Late in life,” notes Samuel Eliot Morison, “President Eliot declared that he had always been thankful for Hill as a predecessor, since it was he who set the University on the path that she was destined to follow.” During his record-setting 40-year presidency (1869-1909), Charles William Eliot transformed Harvard into a modern research university and exerted far-reaching influence on U.S. higher education. The Eliot years saw the establishment of major components such as the Summer School (1871), the Graduate Department (1872; revamped as the Graduate School, 1890), the Arnold Arboretum (1872), Radcliffe College (1879, as the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women; chartered as Radcliffe College, 1894), the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (1890), the School of Landscape Architecture (ca. 1901; forerunner of the Graduate School of Design), the Harvard Forest (Petersham, Mass., 1907), and the Graduate School of Business Administration (1908). For undergraduates, the Eliot years brought the end of compulsory chapel (1886), the undergraduate entrance requirement in Greek (1887), and the much-hated “Scale of Merit” (the nit-picking, Quincy-era grading system whose last traces disappeared in 1886-87, with the introduction of letter grades). One of Eliot’s most influential reforms was the development of a system of “spontaneous diversity of choice,” in which undergraduates selected most of their own courses. Choice, in turn, stimulated an open-ended curriculum. This elective system constituted a radical break with the time-honored academic practice of specifying a student’s courses according to the year of college. The Harvard experiment soon spread nationwide and changed what it meant to be “educated.” By 1894, Eliot himself had concluded that the new system was “the most generally useful piece of work which this university has ever executed.” On May 19, 1909, Eliot retired exactly 40 years after his final confirmation of office and became Harvard’s first president emeritus. Born to the prominent Boston family that produced astronomer Percival Lowell (his brother) and poet Amy Lowell (his sister), President A(bbott) Lawrence Lowell (1909-1933) was a man of high scholarship, high standards, and aristocratic bearing who believed in education for all who had the heart and mind to pursue it. Thus, he wasted no time in establishing the Harvard Extension School (1909) as an open-enrollment evening program for the Greater Boston community. Lowell inherited a College afflicted by a divisive, clubby social outlook that he detested. His inaugural address made clear his desire to restore the “collegiate way of living” that had inspired Harvard’s founding. His correctives shape undergraduate life to this day through the residential House system that he established toward the end of his term, thanks to the generosity of Yale alumnus Edward S. Harkness. After opening the original seven Houses (Adams, Dunster, Eliot, Kirkland, Leverett, Lowell, and Winthrop) in 1930 and 1931, the College began housing freshmen in Yard dormitories. Beyond the House system, Harvard’s physical plant expanded tremendously during the Lowell years, with structures such as the Music Building (1914), Widener Library (opened 1915), Mallinckrodt Laboratory (1928), Dillon Field House (1931), and the Memorial Church (1932). In 1912, Lowell funded the building of a new President’s House at 17 Quincy Street (now Loeb House and home to Harvard’s two Governing Boards). Lowell was also concerned with undergraduate education. His term brought the first general examinations, fields of concentration (elsewhere known as “majors”), distribution requirements for subjects outside the concentration, and tutorials (individual or small-group instruction with a tutor). Beyond the College, the University gained new schools in Education (1920) and Public Health (1922). In 1933, Lowell’s last big dream materialized with the founding of the Society of Fellows, which now allows up to 30 exceptionally promising young scholars (Junior Fellows) to devote three years to full-time scholarship while enjoying regular contact with Senior Fellows in diverse fields. If Lowell greatly expanded the physical Harvard, successor James Bryant Conant (1933-1953) took on the complementary task of filling Lowell’s grand spaces with the energies of a more varied range of students and scholars. At his very first Harvard Corporation meeting in September 1933, Conant proposed an effort later known as the 300th Anniversary Fund, which soon supported the creation of (1) the special academic position of University Professor, which gives exceptional scholars the run of the University to foster cross-disciplinary research on the frontiers of knowledge, and (2) National Scholarships for highly promising students, regardless of financial means. By seeking out and assisting students who might not otherwise attend college, this program significantly enhanced undergraduate diversity. In the midst of World War II, Conant and Provost Paul H. Buck launched a review of the undergraduate curriculum that produced the General Education Program, a reform that shaped Harvard undergraduate studies for more than three decades to come. Through details published in 1945 as “General Education in a Free Society” (a.k.a. the “Red Book”), the program profoundly influenced high school and college curricula nationwide. The Conant years also saw the birth of major new Harvard subdivisions such as the Graduate School of Public Administration (1935; now the John F. Kennedy School of Government), the Graduate School of Design (1936), and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism (1937). In 1939, the President’s Office moved from University Hall to its current location in Massachusetts Hall. Nathan Marsh Pusey (1953-1971) came to Massachusetts Hall after presiding over Lawrence College (Appleton, Wis.), making him the second Harvard chief executive with previous academic presidential experience. A deeply religious man, Pusey took special interest in the Memorial Church and the Divinity School. He was also one of Harvard’s great builders, resuming a scale of new construction to rival that of the Lowell administration. In 1957, Pusey announced the start of A Program for Harvard College, an $82.5 million effort that actually raised $20 million more and resulted in three additions to the undergraduate House system: Quincy House (1959), Leverett Towers (1960), and Mather House (1970). During the 1960s, the Program for Harvard Medicine raised $58 million. In April 1965, the Harvard endowment exceeded $1 billion for the first time. By 1967, Pusey found himself making the case for yet another major fundraising effort, seeking some $160 million for various needs around the University. Other major structures of the Pusey era include the University Herbaria building (ca. 1954), the Loeb Music Library (1956), Conant Chemistry Laboratory (1959), the Loeb Drama Center (1960), the Center for the Study of World Religions (1960), the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts (1963), Peabody Terrace (1964), William James Hall (1965), Larsen Hall (1965), the Countway Library of Medicine (1965), and Holyoke Center (1966). A 1960 bequest from art connoisseur Bernard Berenson, Class of 1887, allowed Villa I Tatti (Berenson’s great and storied estate near Florence, Italy) to become a special Harvard treasure as the home of the Center for Italian Renaissance Studies. Fundraising for structures such as Pusey Library and the undergraduate Science Center began toward the end of Pusey’s term, which witnessed the start of Harvard’s most turbulent era, signaled by the April 1969 occupation of University Hall and an ensuing student strike. Although the dust has not yet settled on the administrations of Harvard’s three living former presidents, each made notable contributions to the institution’s current vitality. Derek Bok, the 25th president (1971-1991), devoted special attention to expanding the Kennedy School of Government – emphasizing the importance of public service at all levels of University life, and advocated enhanced participation in the arts (notably, through the creation of the Office for the Arts). Throughout his presidency, Bok addressed major issues (e.g., South African apartheid and University investments, race relations, and free speech) through open letters to the Harvard community. The Bok years also saw the creation of the Core Curriculum (introduced in 1979-80), the first major overhaul of undergraduate education since the General Education program of the Conant years. In 1977, Bok and Radcliffe President Matina S. Horner signed an agreement that redefined the Harvard-Radcliffe relationship during Radcliffe College’s final 22 years of existence. Bok also led the University in The Harvard Campaign (1979-1984), originally a $250 million effort that was the largest capital drive in the history of U.S. higher education to that point. The drive closed the books with some $8 million more than the revised goal of $350 million. President Neil L. Rudenstine (1991-2001) devoted much energy to bringing more centralization to Harvard’s traditionally diffuse administrative structure. To help manage the huge modern university, Rudenstine revived the position of university provost, a title previously held only by Paul H. Buck during the Conant administration. One of Rudenstine’s most important achievements was the creation of five Interfaculty Initiatives (in the fields of environment, ethics and the professions, schooling and children, mind/brain/behavior, and health policy), designed to foster collaboration across traditional departmental boundaries in an effort to come to grips with the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of modern science, scholarship, and social issues. The Rudenstine years also brought the final, complete integration of Radcliffe into the University. In October 1999, 120-year-old Radcliffe College gave way to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. In 1994, Rudenstine launched The University Campaign, a five-year, $2.1 billion drive that was the largest fundraising effort ever attempted in higher education. By 1999, the drive had pulled in more than $2.65 billion. President Lawrence H. Summers (2001-2006) began the monumental Allston Initiative, a project for developing some 200 acres of Harvard land (beyond the acreage already occupied by the Business School, the Harvard sports complex, and a few other facilities) in the Allston section of Boston. To keep Harvard College accessible to talented students from all economic backgrounds, Summers helped develop the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, under which (starting in 2006) students admitted from families with incomes of less than $60,000 do not have to pay for tuition, room, and board. HFAI also reduces expected contributions from families with incomes of $60,000 to $80,000. In addition, Summers successfully worked to secure for Harvard graduate students the same kinds of financial aid long available to undergraduates. Other important projects of the Summers administration include the Broad Institute (a Harvard-MIT/affiliated hospital effort to harness genomics for clinical medicine), the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, and the Harvard Initiative for Global Health.

Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Jon Hetman Arnold Arboretum Communications Considering the species’ original journey required tens of millions of years and the crossing of an ocean, the arrival of three dawn redwood trees at the president’s house on Tuesday in Cambridge was a walk in the park. In the sun-dappled landscape at Elmwood, President Larry Bacow and Adele Fleet Bacow welcomed Arnold Arboretum Director William (Ned) Friedman and colleagues for an afternoon tree planting. Clones of a 73-year-old dawn redwood at the Arboretum were planted to help celebrate the Arboretum’s 150th anniversary in 2022 and honor a relationship dating back to Harvard’s establishment of the Arboretum in Jamaica Plain in 1872. The Bacows took the lead with ceremonial chrome shovels. (A fourth was planted last April near the Arboretum’s Weld Hill Research Building.) The trees were propagated from hardwood cuttings taken in 2018 from the Arboretum’s oldest dawn redwood (3-48*A), which was accessioned in 1948 as seed and was among the first of its kind to grow in North America in about 60 million years. Since 1995 the Arboretum’s logo has featured a conical silhouette of Metasequoia gyptostoboides — roots exposed and crowning the Arboretum’s founding year of 1872 — embedded in a Harvard shield to symbolize the Arboretum’s relationship to the University and its mission of botanical discovery, international conservation, and education. For its sesquicentennial, the logo adds the year 2022 to reflect the longevity of its Harvard partnership and 150 years of mutual commitment to deepening people’s knowledge of nature. The dawn redwood tree was thought to be extinct until the late 1940s and is the first of its kind to grow in North America in about 60 million years. Until the late 1940s, the tree was known only by the fossil record. Imprints of its characteristic needle pattern found in North America, Europe, and East Asia allowed scientists to describe what they thought was a long-extinct species. Then a forester, Zhan Wang, took samples from a mysterious stand of trees deep in a valley in the Hubei Province of central China and worked with colleagues to collect and identify them. Among these was Hsen Hsu Hu, a prominent professor who had studied at the Arboretum was the first person from China to receive a doctorate in botany from Harvard. In 1946, Hu and a colleague announced the discovery that Metasequoia had not gone extinct after all. It was alive and well and living in western Hubei Province. Elmer Merrill, director of the Arboretum from 1935 to 1946, funded a collecting trip in China to bring back seed. The Arboretum distributed over a kilogram of the tiny, lentil-sized seeds to arboreta and botanic gardens around the world and has since played a crucial role in the tree’s international reinstatement and conservation. Today you can visit the oldest dawn redwood outside of its native China along Conifer Path at the Arboretum. And in about three years, its clones at Elmwood will likely be 12-foot sentinels of a long and fruitful partnership for understanding global biodiversity.

Harvard President Drew Faust (left) and Harvard President-elect Lawrence Bacow speak outside of Massachusetts Hall at Harvard University. Photos by Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Drew Faust and Larry Bacow on learning from each other, the value of humility in decision-making, and the biggest challenges facing higher education Colleen Walsh Harvard Staff Writer Since their first meeting 10 years ago, Drew Faust and Larry Bacow have become invaluable sources of support and advice to each other, as well as good friends. The 28th Harvard president and the 29th sat down at Massachusetts Hall for a conversation that ranged from their childhoods in Virginia and Michigan, respectively, to the art of listening, to the role of colleges and universities in supporting the American dream. Bacow, former chancellor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and president of Tufts University from 2001 to 2011, is a lawyer and economist by training whose research focuses on environmental policy. He will succeed Faust on July 1. GAZETTE: Can you tell me how you met? FAUST: When I was named president in 2007, Larry was president of Tufts, and he called up and invited Charles and me to dinner the first night of my presidency. So on July 1, 2007, Charles and I went to the president’s house. [Charles Rosenberg is President Faust’s husband.] Larry and Adele cooked dinner for us. [Bacow is married to Adele Fleet Bacow.] So that was a lovely beginning. And there is a kind of addendum to this. About a year, a year and a half ago, when I confided to Larry that I was going to be stepping down, we made a date to have dinner on the first night of my non-presidency, which turns out to be the first night of his presidency, which I think neither one of us had anticipated at the moment we set the date. BACOW: Absolutely. FAUST: So on July 1, 2018, we will be having dinner, and by all fairness I ought to cook, but I don’t think I am going to have a kitchen, a place to live. GAZETTE: Where will it be? BACOW: It’s going to be at our place. FAUST: The first day after you step down, I will cook for you. There’s a new date. BACOW: There you go. FAUST: Just to build on this, after we met, Larry was hugely helpful to me as a new president, especially after the financial crisis, when we were both facing things that neither one of us had ever faced before. We did a kind of home-and-home arrangement, where I’d go to Tufts to the president’s house, or he would come to Elmwood. BACOW: We’d open up a nice bottle of something, we’d put a significant dent in it, and we’d commiserate. FAUST: And the financial crisis looked so much better after those conversations. BACOW: When I announced that I was leaving Tufts, I was invited to join the Harvard Corporation, and then we just kept seeing each other. A number of people have asked me about the transition and I keep telling them that this transition is actually much easier than the transition to Tufts because I know the place better. It knows me as well. I think for the last seven years, once a month you and I have had breakfast or lunch and once a month [Provost] Alan [Garber] and I have had breakfast or lunch, which means, since those are often staggered, about every other week I’ve had breakfast or lunch with one of you. To say nothing of all the other meals I have eaten in service to Harvard. So we’ve really gotten to know each other quite well. GAZETTE: What are the most important things you have learned from each other during your respective 10 years leading Harvard and Tufts? FAUST: I remember one of our meetings in the living room at the president’s house at Tufts in the middle of the financial crisis, you shared with me a statement that you had delivered to the Tufts community. I remember thinking, “This is so admirably straightforward. So open about what’s going on, so direct.” I think Larry’s directness during that time was an inspiration to me and reinforcing of instincts that I might have had but may not have dared to act on quite so directly. So that was a big influence. BACOW: Thank you. I’ve learned a lot from Drew over the last seven years about Harvard. Drew has managed with incredible grace to bring Harvard together. We talk about “One Harvard,” but it’s the way in which she has engaged people that I will try to emulate. She’s been a wonderful listener, which is important for any president. But she’s also been a forceful advocate internally for a set of principles and values. You have been very consistent in your messages, and I think that that’s how you get things done, especially in a place that’s as large and decentralized as this one. So there are many things that I will try to emulate, but I can only hope to come close to Drew’s style and grace. GAZETTE: Will you continue to connect with each other for advice and suggestions? BACOW: Oh, yeah. I kid Drew that I’ve added up all the phone calls and the meals together when she has been asking me for advice. So I have this big account surplus which I intend to spend down now. Drew will be on speed dial, trust me. And of course, I will be channeling her at times as well. FAUST: At his request, I will do whatever he asks. I was touched because Katie Tiger, who does my schedule, said, “Larry’s called up and he wants to schedule time with you,” and I thought, Well, I’m not going to be president anymore. She said, “He wants to connect the way you did, once a month.” BACOW: Exactly, once a month. If Charles will allow. Both of our spouses have sort of suffered through these periods where they have had to share us with the rest of the world: Right? And now Charles gets you back, and not just Charles, but your daughter and your friends. GAZETTE: Can you both speak a little bit more about how you balance these public-facing roles with your private lives? BACOW: I think Adele and I have had an advantage, at least relative to many college and university presidents, because we’ve lived in Boston since we came here as freshmen in 1969. And so we have all of these wonderful friends who have known us forever as Adele and Larry. I think when people move to a new city and they show up in these roles, it’s really, really hard to make the kind of friendships that permit you to be unguarded, open, where you share some of your personal frustrations at times with people where it’s safe to do so. And so we are blessed with these friends, and they will still be our friends now that we moved into these new roles. So that’s helped us to preserve a sense of private time. Our children are very important to us. They live in New York City. We have two sons, both married with families of their own. Drew tells me that she’s actually spent a little bit of time in New York during her tenure as president of Harvard, so I am assuming I will have plenty of opportunities to get there as well. But finding time for family and friends is hard. You make a lot of sacrifices in these jobs. FAUST: How old was your youngest son when you started as chancellor at MIT? BACOW: It was Jay’s freshman year in college, so Kenny was a junior in high school. FAUST: So they were pretty far along before you really took on big administrative responsibilities. BACOW: They were. But Adele and Kenny actually did an intervention at one point with me. As chancellor I was going into the office every weekend and they finally had to sit me down to say, “Something has to change.” I went in to talk to [then-MIT President] Chuck Vest the next day, and said, “I am willing to sacrifice a lot for MIT and for this job, but not my family.” And he said: “Absolutely right.” So I restructured things. It’s interesting, when I moved into the presidency in some ways I found it easier to manage my schedule than when I was chancellor at MIT. FAUST: Because you were in charge? BACOW: Because I was in charge. You control your own schedule to a much greater degree as president. FAUST: The advice I would give to any new dean or anybody taking on a big position is: “You are the only person who has your interests at heart in terms of time management. Everyone else is going to try to get you to do stuff, so take control of it.” GAZETTE: I wanted to ask both of you about people you have sought out for advice. FAUST: Oh, my gosh, there are lists and lists and lists. GAZETTE: Anyone who comes to the top? FAUST: Members of our governing board. Different people at different times. Bill Lee has been a wonderful mentor to me from the moment we first met each other at a dinner during the presidential search. A person of such good judgment, and calm in the face of whatever is going on, with a deep understanding of Harvard. He has been terrific. But I am a big advice-seeker. I talk to anybody I can find that I think might have a perspective. I talk to alums when I am on a development visit, and if someone has great accomplishments in running an organization or thinking about financial questions, I just seek their advice on whatever issues are troubling me at the moment. BACOW: In addition to Drew, when I was at Tufts there were a couple of other presidents I always turned to. One was Chuck Vest, another was Bill Bowen, former president of Princeton and the Mellon Foundation, another one was Jim Freedman, the former president of Dartmouth. With certain things I think it’s helpful to talk to people who have sat in the same chair, if not at the same institution. And then we have these wonderful friends who we go way back with. We had a dinner party the first or second year that we were married — this is over 40 years ago. We invited three couples that did not know each other at the time. And the eight of us, joined by one other couple — newbies because they joined 17 years ago — have been getting together for dinner ever since. We’ve grown up together. A couple of us are academics, one is a federal judge, one ran another huge organization. So there’s a lot of life experience there. I can’t think of an issue where I couldn’t learn from people in that group. GAZETTE: Could you both weigh in on what you see as the greatest challenge facing higher education today in the U.S.? FAUST: I would say skepticism about the value of higher education, and skepticism about higher education’s product: facts, science, knowledge, an educated citizenry that is not just narrowly trained but broadly educated. We have to make a case for all of those things, and a lot of our other challenges derive from the reality that I just described. BACOW: I would agree. I think as the real cost of higher education has increased people have adopted more of a consumerist or instrumental approach to higher education. What does it do for me? What’s the return on it in the very narrow, short term? There’s a proposal to evaluate colleges and universities based on the incomes of their graduates after their first job. By that metric, Drew, both you and I would have been considered failures coming out of our alma maters. FAUST: Yep. “One of the things which I learned during my time at Tufts is that a university presidency is a marathon, it’s not a sprint. And having run the Boston Marathon multiple times, I can tell you that one of the big mistakes that new marathon runners make is that they try to go out too fast. And so I anticipate spending a fair amount of this first year listening, learning.” BACOW: Because we each took a first job that paid a pittance relative to some other jobs. So I think that the current narrative about higher education in the U.S. is one that we have to work really hard to change. As Drew says, people are questioning the value of a diploma. They are questioning the value of these institutions to society. They are questioning whether or not colleges and universities actually contribute to the American dream. That’s scary. We need to change that conversation. GAZETTE: As the incoming president of Harvard, what do you see as your greatest challenge in your first year? BACOW: One of the things which I learned during my time at Tufts is that a university presidency is a marathon, it’s not a sprint. And having run the Boston Marathon multiple times, I can tell you that one of the big mistakes that new marathon runners make is that they try to go out too fast. And so I anticipate spending a fair amount of this first year listening, learning. I know a lot about this institution from my time on the Corporation, but that’s nothing close to what I need to know in order to do this job effectively. I would say my biggest challenge is going to be getting to know Harvard really, really well, so that I can be an informed leader and make the kinds of judgments which Drew probably makes like that [snaps fingers]. GAZETTE: Is there something outside of your personal lives, something that has had a big influence on the way you have run things? Anything outside of your professional lives that you have been able to bring into your careers? FAUST: Well, I get asked about this, and the more I am asked about it and the more I answer, the more I am convinced it is true, which is how history has influenced me — how it’s influenced my approach to thinking about this job. I’ve said often that leadership is about change. It’s about people resisting change or embracing change, it’s about bringing an organization through change. But I’ve been thinking recently about how the way I’ve always done history is to listen; to listen to voices from the past to try to figure out how they are seeing the world. And for me that’s how I ended up writing about death. Prior to “This Republic of Suffering,” I wrote a book about Confederate women, and what they were writing about all the time was death. So it was really reading their letters and listening to their voices that made me understand what I needed to say and do and what was important. I think that kind of training in historical listening has been an important part of it, the essence of listening as a leader, which, I think both of us agree, is seminal to how to get the work done. BACOW: It’s interesting how our scholarly backgrounds influence how we see the world and how we do our jobs. I spent a fair amount of time in my career doing research and thinking about bargaining and negotiation and dispute resolution. If you want to try to move a group you need to understand the different interests and perspectives and be able to respond to them. And you need to be able to frame issues in ways so that people can imagine a future that’s different from the past, and can see how there’s a place for them in that future. So, in the same way, Drew, that you probably look at life through the lens of history, I tend to look at life through a lens in which I am trying to understand how one can bring people to consensus, or at least how to create an unblocked coalition. In other words, you can’t always get everybody to agree on a path, but at least if you get enough people to agree it allows you to move forward. In that respect I think my scholarly background also plays a role in how I lead. FAUST: Which came first? Did you become an economist because this was your perspective on the world, or is this the perspective you have because you are an economist? I wonder about that a lot. Was I attracted to history because I tended to see things this way? Or are both true? BACOW: This is what in economics we would call an identification problem [laughs]. I’d have to spend a fair amount of time on somebody’s couch in order to figure that one out. But, you know, it’s also the case that while our disciplinary lenses can help us see and understand the world in ways that we might not otherwise see them, they can also be constricting. And it’s important to understand when to take the glasses off and see the world in different ways. There are times when I have to stop being an economist, and I assume you have to stop being a historian. FAUST: That reminds me of a story about Larry Summers sitting in that chair and me sitting here for five years of his presidency while I was the Radcliffe dean. He talked about the world in a way that was so different from my take on the world, in that things were about numbers and things were about reducing complexity. Humanists always want to enhance complexity. I ended up writing a chapter in “This Republic of Suffering” that I don’t think I would have written had I not had those interactions. It’s a chapter about numbers, about counting the dead and what numbers came to mean and how thinking about numbers was a way to try to grapple with the ineffability of the tragedy. It was really sort of seeing, almost as an anthropologist, how Larry’s mind worked that made me able to see different things in my research. GAZETTE: Can it be daunting, trying to grapple with a wealth of information and knowledge from different sources? Do you ever feel overwhelmed? FAUST: It’s humbling. BACOW: Yes, it is humbling. And you need to approach conversations with humility. I think that’s really important. FAUST: A kind of respect for the craft and culture of the field that you are exploring. BACOW: But at the same time we are also constantly being asked to make judgments about scholarship, about who is worthy of promotion, about who ought to be a dean, about taste, good judgment. And we are being asked to assess people in fields radically distant from our own as well. This is why approaching these decisions with humility is important. GAZETTE: President Faust, you have spoken about how growing up in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley had a strong impact on your choices and your love of history. Incoming President Bacow, I wonder if you could talk about your own background and if being the son of Jewish immigrants from Holocaust-era Europe may have affected the choices you made in your life? BACOW: I think I’ve always felt a certain sense of responsibility to others. I said this when I was introduced to the Harvard community. I think my life in so many respects mirrors that of so many other people whose families came to this country in search of opportunity. This country has just been enormously good to me, and so a lot of what motivates me, a lot of the reasons I agreed to take this job, especially at this point in time for all the reasons we discussed earlier, is to ensure that others have access to the American dream just as I have. So in that respect, I do think it affects my view of the world. It affects how I see my role in the world, and for those of us who have been blessed to be able to study in places like this, to be able to work in places like this, I do think we bear a special responsibility to use the gifts that we’ve been given to try to make the world a better place. GAZETTE: Did either of you have a sense of what you wanted to be when you were young? President Faust, I think you wanted to be a veterinarian? FAUST: Yes, animals are very important to me and always have been. I grew up on a farm and I raised every animal you can imagine as a child. Horses, cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, dogs, cats. BACOW: As a kid growing up I was really interested in science and math. I entered science fairs. I built Heathkits. GAZETTE: Where did that interest come from? BACOW: I loved numbers. I loved science. I read voraciously about science from the time I was really young. I actually ended up going to MIT because I kept reading about it in Popular Science and Scientific American. But I never actually thought I would be a scientist. I always thought I wanted to be a lawyer. It was only after I went to law school that I figured out I didn’t. I am not sorry I went to law school, but I realized I wasn’t cut out to practice law. I was enrolled in a joint degree program between Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School and decided to complete the work for a Ph.D. from the Kennedy School, not intending to be an academic. I thought I was going to go work, with the start of the Carter administration, in Washington, D.C. Then I had an opportunity to fill in for somebody who was on leave from MIT for two years. A two-year, nontenured track. When I was contemplating whether or not to do it I went back to see my mentor at MIT, Bob Solow. He said, “You know, the government will be there when you are ready to go work for it.” So I took the job at MIT and two years turned into 24. And I am still at it on some level. GAZETTE: I noticed an interesting parallel in your childhoods. President Faust, you were in the 4-H Club and the Brownies, while incoming President Bacow was a Boy Scout who eventually made it to Eagle Scout. Were these formative experiences? FAUST: 4-H was very important to me. I loved the responsibility of taking care of this steer and learning all about animal husbandry, and the county agent would stop by to see how I was doing. So it was a lot of fun. BACOW: I learned a lot in Boy Scouts. One of the things which I learned is that I enjoy teaching. I went to Boy Scout camp one summer — you would only go for a week — and at the end of the week they realized that the person who was supposed to teach the next cooking merit badge session wasn’t going to show up, so they needed somebody to do that. FAUST: So you have a cooking merit badge? BACOW: Oh, I do. Not only that but I taught cooking merit badge. FAUST: Wow, I should have recognized that when I had that delicious dinner back in 2007. BACOW: In fact, the final project for each of my students was that they had to bake a pie in a Dutch oven over an open flame. It was the first time I ever had an opportunity to teach, and I realized I enjoyed teaching. That’s where the seed was planted. But I also learned a lot of other useful life skills. GAZETTE: I wonder how being a professor has helped inform leadership for each of you? FAUST: It was absolutely defining in that it gives you a perspective on the university from one of the most, if not the most, important elements of the university — the faculty. They are the ones who live through an era at a university, and have so much responsibility and power in university governance, and embody the intellectual mission of the place. So understanding that culture and those values was very important. On a more instrumental level I think that teaching large classes, lecturing, answering questions, having to explain things to people, was an invaluable preparation for the kind of work a president does. It’s about learning how to communicate and explaining things to people that they might not understand initially or that they might not know about, and responding to their queries about issues. Those are all things that are very much a part of my life every day. BACOW: I avoided academic administration for 21 of my 24 years as a faculty member. FAUST: You know both of us did that. We are both really late starters. BACOW: I loved the life of a faculty member. Why screw it up? It was a wonderful life. When I moved into administration, when I became chancellor at MIT, I found that there was an interesting opportunity to fix things that bothered me as a faculty member and it was very gratifying to be able to do that. Now what I say all the time, because I believe it, and I know Drew does as well, is the job of an administration, our job, is to enable faculty to do their best work, their best teaching, their best scholarship. And I think if you haven’t done it yourself, you don’t know what that is. And so I think we do what we do because we believe in the work of the faculty. If we didn’t, then I think we would be miscast in these roles. FAUST: Well put. “I worry sometimes that we don’t take enough joy in what the work of this place is. It’s very serious work and it’s work that has enormous relevance and impact, and changes lives, as you were describing. But it’s also so miraculous to be here with people learning and discovering and to be sharing that with them.” GAZETTE: What’s the hardest part about being a university president? BACOW: The hardest part is keeping your waistline under control [laughter]. I used to joke when I was at Tufts that my real title was not president, it was university stomach. But I ate in service to the institution. FAUST: Yes, eating for Harvard. BACOW: Don’t you find it that way? FAUST: Oh, yes. BACOW: So that was one of the hardest things. FAUST: I think the hardest part is just having to be steady and always know that how you react to a situation is going to affect so many people around you. In a moment of difficulty or crisis or whatever it might be, you need to be a symbol of the institution. The responsibility is wonderful in many ways because it comes with the ability to do things and to fix things and to change things and accomplish things. But it is also in itself a huge responsibility. BACOW: One piece of advice I give to every new university president I speak to is to always do the right thing. It’s usually not that difficult to figure out; it’s often excruciatingly difficult to do. And being able to constantly focus on what’s the right thing for the institution long-term. Watching how others have maintained their balance through difficult times can be very instructive and very reassuring. These jobs are not for the faint of heart. GAZETTE: President Faust, is there one piece of advice you would offer your friend as he steps into this role? FAUST: Make sure you do things that just give you joy. There is so much around this campus. In the myriad of choices and obligations that people will present to you, make sure you put lots of them in there that you enjoy. Because there is much joy to be had, and I worry sometimes that we don’t take enough joy in what the work of this place is. It’s very serious work and it’s work that has enormous relevance and impact, and changes lives, as you were describing. But it’s also so miraculous to be here with people learning and discovering and to be sharing that with them. So celebrate that. BACOW: I will. GAZETTE: Thank you both so much for taking the time. FAUST: Of course. BACOW: This was fun. GAZETTE: My last question, for incoming President Bacow: Red Sox or Detroit Tigers? BACOW: Red Sox, Bruins, Celtics, Patriots.
