Harvard University 's Smith Campus Center (formerly Holyoke Center ) is a brutalist administrative and service building located in Harvard Square , Cambridge, Massachusetts . Opposite the Wadsworth Gate to Harvard Yard on Massachusetts Avenue , it functions as a student center , as well as housing Harvard administrative offices, University Health Services , and a restaurant arcade. Primarily designed by José Luis Sert (then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design ) and completed in 1966, the Smith Campus Center is an H-shaped ten-story reinforced concrete building. Low-rise portions, including an underground parking garage , have a larger footprint of 360,000 square feet (33,000 m 2 ). The building was constructed in two phases over a six-year period between 1960 and 1966. The first phase—the southern half of the building facing Mount Auburn Street—began in 1960 and was occupied in 1962. Construction of the second phase began in 1964 and was completed in 1966. The landscaped area at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Dunster Street—known as Forbes Plaza—was completed the following year in 1967. As a permanent tribute, the plaza and arcade inside the Holyoke Center were named in honor of Edward W. Forbes . The occasion was marked by a ceremony on 17 October 1966 After the first phase of construction in 1963, the Harvard Crimson cited a local joke: "The one nice feature about Holyoke Center is that it's the one place in Cambridge from which you can't see Holyoke Center". Within a few years the building's novel design and technical features began to present numerous difficulties, which a Harvard official likened to "a five-car accident at an intersection. You just can't tell what caused it." These included crumbling of exterior structural concrete and an inefficient three-pipe heating and cooling system. It was Harvard's first highrise building, and has been called a " gray elephant " for the color of its concrete facades. From 1964 to 1979, the penthouse dining room was decorated with five large paintings installed by Mark Rothko , an Abstract Expressionist artist. Due to high levels of direct sunlight onto the paintings and the presence of lithol red's calcium salt, the paintings faded severely and were moved to protective storage in 1979. Since their removal, the artworks have been publicly displayed only five times, most recently from November 2014 to July 2015, at the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums . Danh Vō 's We the People was installed in honor of Drew Gilpin Faust as part of the renovation of the building in 2018. [ failed verification ] Originally known as Holyoke Center, in 2013 it was renamed the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center. Over the next several years, its underwent extensive renovation to create gathering, lounge, and study spaces, and space for exhibitions, events, and performances, after reopening in 2018.

Brigid O’Rourke Harvard Correspondent Harvard University unveiled its initial design concepts for the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center during two open houses on Thursday and Friday. More than 80 members of the Harvard and Cambridge communities attended the viewings, curious to get a glimpse of renderings and initial plans for the 1960s building across from Harvard Yard. Representatives from the project team were on hand to answer questions, solicit feedback, and talk through ideas. Two more sessions are scheduled for the Harvard community on Feb. 2 and 4. An additional session will be scheduled for the Greater Cambridge community, also in February. “I am incredibly pleased at the turnout we had for our first open house. The ideas and feedback we’ve received have been — and will continue to be — invaluable as we develop the programmatic and design aspects of the building,” said Executive Vice President Katie Lapp . “Feedback from all members of the Harvard community is absolutely essential to ensuring that the Smith Campus Center fosters intellectual, cultural, and social experiences for all members of our community. I hope to see even more folks at the open houses scheduled for the next week.” Formerly known as Holyoke Center, the building was renamed in 2014 in honor of Richard A. and Susan F. Smith, who donated the funds for its renovation. The redesigned center is expected to provide a major boost to the University’s multiyear effort — through the Common Spaces Program — to create and improve locations that foster campus’s intellectual, cultural, and social campus experience for the Harvard community. A comprehensive set of renderings, depicting both interior and exterior images, were on display. One showed a new, transparent pavilion facing Massachusetts Avenue, which will provide a welcoming and vibrant entrance alongside a redesigned exterior plaza. Other renderings showed how the lower levels of the building are being reconceived as multi-level spaces for formal and informal gatherings, with food venues, flexible meeting spaces, landscaped courts, and roof terraces. The 10th floor will offer additional common spaces with magnificent views of the Charles River, Harvard Yard, and sections of campus beyond the river. Students, faculty, and staff have been engaged throughout the planning process. Community input has been garnered through public meetings in Harvard Square and at a community open house. Harvard planners conducted more than 25 focus groups and received nearly 6,000 responses to a campus-wide survey. The first two open houses, combined with the upcoming ones, are key steps in that extensive outreach process. “We’re really excited about the available collaborative space. We’re working on making an entrepreneurship hub on this side of the river. And for us, the ability to be able to reserve a space to work, meet, or do projects is really key,” said Eric Ouyang ’17. “It will be so nice to have something like this campus center that’s so inclusive and so centrally located.” Harvard has also prioritized sustainability in the project and is using an integrated approach for design and construction, with a goal of creating a space that visually and symbolically represents Harvard’s commitment to sustainability. The design process is driven in accordance with the Harvard Green Building Standards, as well as the University’s five-year sustainability plan, which lays out goals and priorities for building and operating a healthier, more sustainable community. The design is still preliminary but is expected to include green roofs and walls, plentiful natural light, rainwater collection and reuse, a high-performance glass facade that maximizes energy efficiency, an interior garden for the arcade, and healthy-building materials. “We’re really excited to see these plans, especially since they’ve incorporated so much green space,” said Lacey Klingensmith, a student in the sustainability and environmental master’s program at the Extension School. “Right now, there is such a scarcity of open space with natural light, and we think this will be great for students.” The project will roll out concurrently with a project focused on cleaning and restoring the facade. The greater Cambridge community and the public will continue to be welcome in the building. Additional open houses for the Harvard community are scheduled for Monday from 4 to 6 p.m., and Wednesday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., on the second floor of the campus center. (Attendees should use the 1344 Massachusetts Ave. entrance, which is to the left of the main entrance.) As with the first events, attendees are welcome to have their questions answered or engage with project planners. After gaining input on the project, the Cambridge Historical Commission, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeals, and the Harvard Square Advisory Committee will have to give their approvals. That permitting process will begin later this year.

Photo by Liza Voll New Smith Campus Center is a welcome to all Reimagined, redesigned, and replete with new restaurants and study spaces, the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center officially opened Thursday with a dedication ceremony attended by Harvard President Larry Bacow, President Emerita Drew Faust, and members of the Harvard and Cambridge communities. The center is an anchor for Harvard’s campus, and now a crossroads for the entire community. The first and second floors include the Moise Y. Safra Welcome Pavilion and Plaza along Massachusetts Avenue, where people can mingle, join tours of Harvard, and take in views of the square and the city beyond. Outside, new plazas open to Mass. Ave. and Mount Auburn Street; while indoors people lounge in large interior spaces with soaring ceilings, and a new roof deck along Dunster Street. With its open-air vitrine garden, glass facades, and green walls irrigated with UV-filtered rainwater harvested from the center’s rooftop, the renovations increase access to daylight and nature. Hungry passersby can grab a bite at Pavement Coffeehouse , Swissbäkers, Bon Me, Blackbird Doughnuts , and Oggi Gourmet , which will be joined in the coming weeks by Whole Heart Provisions and James Beard winner Jody Adams’ Saloniki . The center also offers spaces for meeting and performances, or a game of chess at any of 14 new tables. The Campus Center first opened in 1966, designed by renowned architect Josep Lluís Sert, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design from 1953 to 1969. The renovations were designed by Hopkins Architects of London, with the Cambridge-based firms Bruner/Cott as executive architect and Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates as landscape architect.

Title: Plans for Smith Campus Center
Date: January 14, 2015

Body:
Design concepts for Harvard’s Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center were recently unveiled. The concepts grew out of an extensive process of engaging students, faculty, and staff about their visions for the future of the building at the heart of Harvard’s campus, particularly as plans for Allston come to fruition. Courtesy of Hopkins Architects Brigid O’Rourke Harvard Correspondent With a series of open houses scheduled for later this month, planners recently unveiled design concepts for the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center that include new formal and informal gathering areas, a wide variety of eating options, flexible meeting or event spaces, fireplaces, landscaped gardens, and even a roof terrace. Public areas will be suffused with natural light, while the exterior plazas along Massachusetts Avenue and Mount Auburn Street will be reinvigorated. “The new Smith Campus Center will embody the aspirations and values that we hold dear and seek to preserve. It will draw us together more closely, strengthening the sense of community at Harvard by encouraging spontaneous interactions among students, faculty, and staff, as well as members of the broader community,” said Harvard President Drew Faust. “While plans are not yet final, and we have more feedback to gather, we are all pleased with the project’s direction and progress.” The concepts grew out of an extensive process of engaging students, faculty, and staff about their visions for the future of the building at the heart of Harvard’s campus, particularly as plans for Allston come to fruition. Community feedback was also garnered from public meetings regarding Harvard Square. Having already conducted more than 25 focus groups and with nearly 6,000 responses to a University-wide survey, the committee charged with programming the Smith Campus Center is developing a schedule of open houses in late January to introduce specific programmatic concepts and designs to the Harvard and Cambridge communities. “One of our key design objectives was to ensure that the building engages the vibrancy of all of Harvard Square,” said Tanya Iatridis, senior director of University planning. Based on the feedback planners have already received, the center — which already hosts Harvard’s housing, ID, and parking offices — will bring together additional service functions, including the FAS Registrar’s Office and ticketing services, to make them more accessible to the campus community. In response to student requests, new space may be included for student collaboration, including offices for both the undergraduate and graduate councils. While the feedback process revealed a multitude of different views, nearly everyone agreed that not including the 10th floor — with its glorious views of Boston, the Charles River, and Harvard Yard — would be a wasted opportunity. Instead, new common spaces will be created to harness the vistas for University meetings, events, and social space. A highlight of the lower levels of the campus center will be a striking open-plan, multi-level, common space for relaxing, eating, and socializing, and it would be used for occasional large events and gatherings. “The new Smith Campus Center will be a central meeting point — from Cambridge to Longwood to Allston, and from undergraduates to graduates to faculty, staff, and visitors. It will complement our current House system and only enhance the important social, educational, and cultural relationships and bonds that are such a part of life at Harvard,” said Meredith Weenick, vice president for campus services. “The building will be welcoming to all members of our community — faculty, staff, and students — with many different types of spaces that will allow for a variety of uses.” Open houses for the Harvard community will be held on Monday (Jan. 26) from 4 to 6 p.m.; Tuesday (Jan. 27) from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Friday (Jan. 30) from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Additional open houses for the Cambridge community will be scheduled for later this month. All open houses will be held on the second floor of the campus center, at the 1344 Massachusetts Ave. entrance along Forbes Plaza, above the Cambridge Trust Company bank. While the plans have yet to be finalized, pending additional community feedback at the open houses and the securing of permits from public agencies, construction will affect current and future users over the coming four years. In particular, the ground-floor level of the center will be an active construction zone with a focus on renovating the arcade. Current retail tenants will likely be moving out by the end of this year. Based on public approvals, construction could begin in early 2016, with the new center opening in 2018. A majority of the building will remain open during construction, and many University tenants will remain in place throughout. “We are deeply grateful to Richard A. and Susan F. Smith for the generous donation that is making this renovation possible. Their foresight and vision will shape the experiences of countless individuals, and we are eager to create a vibrant campus center that will be part of the campus of the next century,” said Faust. The campus center project team has retained London-based Hopkins Architects , with Cambridge-based Bruner/Cott as executive architect and the Cambridge office of Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates as landscape architect to transform programmatic goals into a physical design.
