The Harvard Lampoon Building (sometimes referred to as the Lampoon Castle ) is a historic building in Cambridge, Massachusetts , which is best known as the home of The Harvard Lampoon , and for its unusual design. The building was constructed at 44 Bow Street not far from Harvard Yard and close to the "Gold Coast" of residences for undergraduates of Harvard College before the creation of Harvard's "house system" (some of them now part of Adams House ). Designed by Edmund M. Wheelwright , who also oversaw the construction, it was first opened on February 19, 1909. Wheelwright had attended Harvard University and was one of the founders of the Harvard Lampoon . Wheelwright's design was inspired in part by an old church in Jamestown, Virginia , and by the Flemish Renaissance details of Auburn Street buildings in its vicinity. The building has been described as a "Satirical Castle". During the construction phase of the project he traveled to Europe to procure appropriate furnishings and windows. He purchased leaded windows in Belgium and an Elizabethan mantelpiece in England. The building also features 17th-century Delft tiles that were imported from the Netherlands. The Delft tiles are blue, white, and aubergine . The tiles were used in a room with an open ceiling and plain furniture and timbers. The ground floor features a small entrance and a round library used for editorial meetings. The floor opens up and there is a secret chamber beneath the library (a "basement") used for "secret" events. The building features a copper ibis , symbol of the Lampoon , mounted on the top of the dome. The statue is roughly 4 feet (1.2 m) high and weighs roughly 70 pounds (32 kg). Though it was first installed in 1909, it has frequently been stolen and returned ever since. On one occasion members of The Harvard Crimson , the student newspaper and rival of the Lampoon , which issues an annual Crimson parody issue, stole the statue and presented it as a gift to the Russian delegation to the UN. After initially promising to install it on top of a building at Moscow State University , the delegation returned the statue. The building cost approximately $40,000 to construct, making it then the most expensive headquarters of a college newspaper in the United States. After the building was first constructed, it initially hosted a small store on the ground floor in addition to the Harvard Lampoon offices and meeting spaces on the other floors; for years the site housed a used book shop, Starr Books. In 2023 a major restoration project led to the installation of a second fire escape to the building, numerous structural repairs, and the return of Ludowici tile to the roof decades after its removal in the mid-1950s. Barrett Wendell once described the building as "sturdily honest as the founder who designed it, yet laughing at every turn with freakish gayety and beauty." However, the building's architecture has been criticized, most notably by former Cambridge mayor Alfred Vellucci . He once described it as "one of the ugliest buildings in the world" and claimed that "it does nothing but scare strangers" and "looks like a witch on a broomstick." He also noted that the location of the building "is an ideal spot for a restroom", and once unsuccessfully proposed a city ordinance declaring the building a public urinal . The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Vellucci later clashed with the Harvard Lampoon due to a tree that he planted on city land in front of the building in 1961 in order to block the view of the building. He wished to obscure the face of the building because he found it ugly and to avenge local Italian Americans , whom he believed the Lampoon had insulted by claiming that an Irishman (rather than the Italian Christopher Columbus ) discovered America. Vellucci's opposition was also fueled in part by the proposal from members of the Harvard Lampoon to rename a nearby intersection "Lampoon Square", and by the satirical portraits of Vellucci that they published. During the sixties, seventies, and eighties the tree was routinely vandalized, its branches often chopped off and acid was poured on the tree twice. However, in 1991 the tree was completely chopped down. The Harvard Lampoon refused to confirm or deny involvement in the event and a smaller tree was planted in its place. Three years later the tree was felled on the night of Harvard's commencement. The leadership of the Harvard Lampoon denied any complicity, and suggested that it may have been a false flag operation by members of the Harvard Crimson .

Story and photo by Rose Lincoln Gazette Staff When curator Joe Hickey found the original 1909 architectural plans for the Harvard Lampoon building where he works he rolled up his sleeves and got down to business. According to the plans, the ears on the face of the Mt. Auburn Street building shot out steam on every hour. When Hickey dug into the records he discovered the reason for the shooting steam was not aesthetic but rather to save money – and “snub” the University. The plans, written by founding member Edmund M. Wheelwright, stated that steam would enter through underground pipes from the building across the street. In 1909, bills for steam heat were assessed by measuring the steam that came through the “return line” in the form of vapor. If there was no return vapor the user could not be charged. So each time the face on the facade of the Lampoon shot steam out its ears, the Lampoon staff simultaneously saved money and tweaked the University by avoiding the return line. With ease, Hickey reels off incredible and obscure facts about the Lampoon’s past. And he proudly proclaims it as the place where the creators of David Letterman’s Top Ten List got their start, where the writers of “The Simpsons,” “Saturday Night Live,” and “Seinfeld” once worked and partied. Asked why a student chooses The Lampoon over the student-run newspaper, The Crimson, Hickey confidently replies: “If you want to become rich and famous you start at the Lampoon.” Hickey’s dedication to the Lampoon is evident everywhere around the historic building. From the recently constructed wood coverings for all the radiators to the restored Senior Dinner poster he found in the basement. The poster had a dark liquor stain covering a portion of it, and when restored, showed 1954 Lampoon President John Updike’s signature and a drawing of himself in the upper corner. It now hangs on the wall with other memorabilia. Drapes cover the second-floor windows to discourage peeping. When the drapes are open, memorabilia such as the Updike poster are visible on nearly every inch of wall space and are well-protected by the UV glass Hickey has recently installed. As Hickey leads a recent visitor through the venerable structure, he remarks on the daily surprises he encounters in his job at the Lampoon. “This place becomes their home,” says Hickey of the students who work there, “not their dorms, but here at the Lampoon.” Almost on cue, he switches a light on in a room in the basement. A student wrapped in a sleeping bag is asleep on a shelf. Hickey apologizes to the student, shuts off the light, and the tour continues. When returning graduates stop by to visit, it’s Hickey they recognize and share a beer with. Besides the returning alums, Hickey and the Lampoon staff have played host to such notables as Aerosmith, Updike, John Irving, Tom Wolfe, Phil Hartman, Conan O’Brien, and Mr. T. When the Lampoon hosts an awards dinner, gentlemen arrive in tuxedos and ladies in gowns and tiaras. Candles light the rooms. While little electricity is used for the lighting, it’s most emphatically used to power the $5,000 speakers that blare music and rock the many parties. Hickey has just two predecessors: Elmer Green, who died in 1977 with a Lampoon staffer at his bedside, and Bob Stewart, who was curator before Green and whose dedication was such that he officially changed his name to Bob Lampoon. The basement room where Green lived for 50 years (and for more than half of that time on a dirt floor) has been named for him. Hickey watches over “The Elmer Room” and all the rooms of the building and joins in the fun at every Lampoon event, but unlike his predecessors he does not live in the basement and has no plans to change his name. In 1998, when multimillionaire alumnus Bill Vogel came to visit, Hickey mentioned what he’d found in Wheelwright’s 1886 architectural plans. Armed with Vogel’s financial backing and encouragement, Hickey purchased and installed a steam generator, wiring it to a timer and once again, as in days gone by, for five minutes before each hour, the funny face called The Lampoon spews steam out its ears.

Animal explorers traversing the Harvard campus will encounter curious squirrels in the Yard, flocks of wild turkeys near the residences, and red-tailed hawks hopping from tower to tower. More exotic creatures lurk everywhere. On building facades, gates, and shields, a closer look reveals a host of nature’s and mythic beasts, from lions to buffalo, from eagles to owls, a famous pair of rhinos, and even a Pegasus and a unicorn. Most gather close to the Charles River, their source of water, along the perimeter gates, or surround the Bio Labs, near the scientists who study them. The Yard is largely unpopulated, save for the humans guarded under John Harvard’s close watch. For the New England area, the variety of species is astounding. An inventory reveals such unusual stock as a jaguar, tapir, pelican, iguana, and a giant anteater. Explore the campus wildlife, where animals are etched and cast in stone, brick, and metal. An owl clutches a mouse in its talons while cattle sit on a shield along the gate surrounding the Winthrop House courtyards. Lions, the most populous of the beasts roaming campus, decorate the gate on Quincy Street and the entrance above Claverly Hall. A pair of lions flank the entrance to the Harvard-Yenching Library. An eagle and a pair of concerned lions adorn Adolphus Busch Hall. An ibis keeps watch over the Harvard Lampoon building, while across Mount Auburn Street a feline embellishes a weathervane. On the three doors to the Bio Labs, 24 organisms, insects, and fauna from sea, air, and land, including this trilobite and jellyfish, are magnified in bronze. Katharine Ward Lane Weems worked with scientists and craftsmen to design this celebration of the natural world. The White Rabbit and Cheshire Cat perch on the newly designed gate near Houghton Library along Quincy Street. The Peter J. Solomon Gate took its inspiration from the first edition of “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.” A blue horse head tops the gate to Dunster House. A Pegasus lugs a literary tome on the pediment of the Harvard Advocate building on South Street. Since its founding in 1886, the winged horse has been the symbol of the literary magazine, the oldest continuously published college art and literary magazine.
